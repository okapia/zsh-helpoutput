Usage: mdadm arraydevice options component devices...

This usage is for managing the component devices within an array.
The --manage option is not needed and is assumed if the first argument
is a device name or a management option.
The first device listed will be taken to be an md array device, and
subsequent devices are (potential) components of that array.

Options that are valid with management mode are:
  --add         -a   : hotadd subsequent devices to the array
  --remove      -r   : remove subsequent devices, which must not be active
  --fail        -f   : mark subsequent devices a faulty
  --set-faulty       : same as --fail
  --run         -R   : start a partially built array
  --stop        -S   : deactivate array, releasing all resources
  --readonly    -o   : mark array as readonly
  --readwrite   -w   : mark array as readwrite
