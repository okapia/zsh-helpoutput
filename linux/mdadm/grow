Usage: mdadm --grow device options

This usage causes mdadm to attempt to reconfigure a running array.
This is only possibly if the kernel being used supports a particular
reconfiguration.  This version supports changing the number of
devices in a RAID1/5/6, changing the active size of all devices in
a RAID1/4/5/6, adding or removing a write-intent bitmap, and changing
the error mode for a 'FAULTY' array.

Options that are valid with the grow (-G --grow) mode are:
  --level=       -l   : Tell mdadm what level the array is so that it can
                      : interpret '--layout' properly.
  --layout=      -p   : For a FAULTY array, set/change the error mode.
  --size=        -z   : Change the active size of devices in an array.
                      : This is useful if all devices have been replaced
                      : with larger devices.   Value is in Kilobytes, or
                      : the special word 'max' meaning 'as large as possible'.
  --raid-devices= -n  : Change the number of active devices in an array.
  --bitmap=      -b   : Add or remove a write-intent bitmap.
  --backup-file= file : A file on a differt device to store data for a
                      : short time while increasing raid-devices on a
                      : RAID4/5/6 array. Not needed when a spare is present.
  --array-size=  -Z   : Change visible size of array.  This does not change
                      : any data on the device, and is not stable across restarts.
