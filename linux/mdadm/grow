Usage: mdadm --grow device options

This usage causes mdadm to attempt to reconfigure a running array.
This is only possibly if the kernel being used supports a particular
reconfiguration.

Options that are valid with the grow (-G --grow) mode are:
  --level=       -l   : Tell mdadm what level to convert the array to.
  --layout=      -p   : For a FAULTY array, set/change the error mode.
                      : for other arrays, update the layout
  --size=        -z   : Change the active size of devices in an array.
                      : This is useful if all devices have been replaced
                      : with larger devices.   Value is in Kilobytes, or
                      : the special word 'max' meaning 'as large as possible'.
  --assume-clean      : When increasing the --size, this flag will avoid
                      : a resync of the new space
  --chunk=       -c   : Change the chunksize of the array
  --raid-devices= -n  : Change the number of active devices in an array.
  --add=         -a   : Add listed devices as part of reshape.  This is
                      : needed for resizing a RAID0 which cannot have
                      : spares already present.
  --bitmap=      -b   : Add or remove a write-intent bitmap.
  --backup-file= file : A file on a different device to store data for a
                      : short time while increasing raid-devices on a
                      : RAID4/5/6 array. Also needed throughout a reshape
                      : when changing parameters other than raid-devices
  --array-size=  -Z   : Change visible size of array.  This does not change
                      : any data on the device, and is not stable across restarts.
  --data-offset=      : Location on device to move start of data to.
