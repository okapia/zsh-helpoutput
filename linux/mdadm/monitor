Usage: mdadm --monitor options devices

This usage causes mdadm to monitor a number of md arrays by periodically
polling their status and acting on any changes.
If any devices are listed then those devices are monitored, otherwise
all devices listed in the config file are monitored.
The address for mailing advisories to, and the program to handle
each change can be specified in the config file or on the command line.
If no mail address or program are specified, then mdadm reports all
state changes to stdout.

Options that are valid with the monitor (-F --follow) mode are:
  --mail=       -m   : Address to mail alerts of failure to
  --program=    -p   : Program to run when an event is detected
  --alert=           : same as --program
  --syslog      -y   : Report alerts via syslog
  --increment=  -r   : Report RebuildNN events in the given increment. default=20
  --delay=      -d   : seconds of delay between polling state. default=60
  --config=     -c   : specify a different config file
  --scan        -s   : find mail-address/program in config file
  --daemonise   -f   : Fork and continue in child, parent exits
  --pid-file=   -i   : In daemon mode write pid to specified file instead of stdout
  --oneshot     -1   : Check for degraded arrays, then exit
  --test        -t   : Generate a TestMessage event against each array at startup
