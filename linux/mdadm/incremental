Usage: mdadm --incremental [-Rqrsf] device

This usage allows for incremental assembly of md arrays.  Devices can be
added one at a time as they are discovered.  Once an array has all expected
devices, it will be started.

Optionally, the process can be reversed by using the fail option.
When fail mode is invoked, mdadm will see if the device belongs to an array
and then both fail (if needed) and remove the device from that array.

Options that are valid with incremental assembly (-I --incremental) are:
  --run         -R : Run arrays as soon as a minimal number of devices are
                   : present rather than waiting for all expected.
  --quiet       -q : Don't print any information messages, just errors.
  --rebuild-map -r : Rebuild the 'map' file that mdadm uses for tracking
                   : partial arrays.
  --scan        -s : Use with -R to start any arrays that have the minimal
                   : required number of devices, but are not yet started.
  --fail        -f : First fail (if needed) and then remove device from
                   : any array that it is a member of.
