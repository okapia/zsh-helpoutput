Usage: mdadm --incremental [-Rqrs] device

This usage allows for incremental assembly of md arrays.  Devices can be
added one at a time as they are discovered.  Once an array has all expected
devices, it will be started.

Options that are valid with incremental assembly (-I --incremental) more are:
  --run       -R  : run arrays as soon as a minimal number of devices are
                  : present rather than waiting for all expected.
  --quiet     -q  : Don't print any information messages, just errors.
  --rebuild   -r  : Rebuild the 'map' file that mdadm uses for tracking
                  : partial arrays.
  --scan      -s  : Use with -R to start any arrays that have the minimal
                  : required number of devices, but are not yet started.
