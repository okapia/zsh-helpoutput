Usage:  mdadm --build device -chunk=X --level=Y --raid-devices=Z devices

 This usage is similar to --create.  The difference is that it creates
 a legacy array without a superblock.  With these arrays there is no
 different between initially creating the array and subsequently
 assembling the array, except that hopefully there is useful data
 there in the second case.

 The level may only be 0, raid0, or linear.
 All devices must be listed and the array will be started once complete.
 Options that are valid with --build (-B) are:
  --bitmap=          : file to store/find bitmap information in.
  --chunk=      -c   : chunk size of kibibytes
  --rounding=        : rounding factor for linear array (==chunk size)
  --level=      -l   : 0, raid0, or linear
  --raid-devices= -n : number of active devices in array
  --bitmap-chunk=    : bitmap chunksize in Kilobytes.
  --delay=      -d   : bitmap update delay in seconds.
