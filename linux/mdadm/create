Usage:  mdadm --create device -chunk=X --level=Y --raid-devices=Z devices

 This usage will initialise a new md array, associate some
 devices with it, and activate the array.   In order to create an
 array with some devices missing, use the special word 'missing' in
 place of the relevant device name.

 Before devices are added, they are checked to see if they already contain
 raid superblocks or filesystems.  They are also checked to see if
 the variance in device size exceeds 1%.
 If any discrepancy is found, the user will be prompted for confirmation
 before the array is created.  The presence of a '--run' can override this
 caution.

 If the --size option is given then only that many kilobytes of each
 device is used, no matter how big each device is.
 If no --size is given, the apparent size of the smallest drive given
 is used for raid level 1 and greater, and the full device is used for
 other levels.

 Options that are valid with --create (-C) are:
  --bitmap=          : Create a bitmap for the array with the given filename
                     : or an internal bitmap is 'internal' is given
  --chunk=      -c   : chunk size in kibibytes
  --rounding=        : rounding factor for linear array (==chunk size)
  --level=      -l   : raid level: 0,1,4,5,6,10,linear,multipath and synonyms
  --parity=     -p   : raid5/6 parity algorithm: {left,right}-{,a}symmetric
  --layout=          : same as --parity, for RAID10: [fno]NN 
  --raid-devices= -n : number of active devices in array
  --spare-devices= -x: number of spare (eXtra) devices in initial array
  --size=       -z   : Size (in K) of each drive in RAID1/4/5/6/10 - optional
  --data-offset=     : Space to leave between start of device and start
                     : of array data.
  --force       -f   : Honour devices as listed on command line.  Don't
                     : insert a missing drive for RAID5.
  --run         -R   : insist of running the array even if not all
                     : devices are present or some look odd.
  --readonly    -o   : start the array readonly - not supported yet.
  --name=       -N   : Textual name for array - max 32 characters
  --bitmap-chunk=    : bitmap chunksize in Kilobytes.
  --delay=      -d   : bitmap update delay in seconds.
  --write-journal=   : Specify journal device for RAID-4/5/6 array
