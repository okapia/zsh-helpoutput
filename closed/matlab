    -h|-help             - Display arguments.
    -n                   - Display final environment variables,
                           arguments, and other diagnostic
                           information. MATLAB is not run.
    -e                   - Display ALL the environment variables and
                           their values to standard output. MATLAB
                           is not run. If the exit status is not
                           0 on return then the variables and values
                           may not be correct.
    -arch                - Start MATLAB assuming architecture arch.
    v=variant            - Start the version of MATLAB found
                           in bin/sol64/variant instead of bin/sol64.
    v=arch/variant       - Start the version of MATLAB found
                           in bin/arch/variant instead of bin/sol64.
    -c licensefile       - Set location of the license file that MATLAB
                           should use.  It can have the form port@host or
                           be a colon separated list of license files.
                           The LM_LICENSE_FILE and MLM_LICENSE_FILE
                           environment variables will be ignored.
    -display Xdisplay    - Send X commands to X server display, Xdisplay.
    -nodisplay           - Do not display any X commands. The MATLAB
                           desktop will not be started. However, unless
                           -nojvm is also provided the Java virtual machine
                           will be started.
    -nosplash            - Do not display the splash screen during startup.
    -mwvisual visualid   - The default X visual to use for figure windows.
    -debug               - Provide debugging information especially for X
                           based problems.
    -desktop             - Allow the MATLAB desktop to be started by a
                           process without a controlling terminal. This is
                           usually a required command line argument when
                           attempting to start MATLAB from a window manager
                           menu or desktop icon.
    -nodesktop           - Do not start the MATLAB desktop. Use the current
                           terminal for commands. The Java virtual machine
                           will be started.
    -nojvm               - Shut off all Java support by not starting the
                           Java virtual machine. In particular the MATLAB
                           desktop will not be started.
    -memmgr manager      - Set environment variable MATLAB_MEM_MGR to
                           manager. manager can have one of the following
                           values:
                           cache   - Default.
                           compact - (32-bit addressing only) For large
                                     models or MATLAB code that uses many
                                     structure or object variables. It is
                                     not helpful for large arrays.
                           debug   - Does memory integrity checking. Useful
                                     for debugging memory problems caused by
                                     user mex files.
    -check_malloc        - Same as '-memmgr debug'.
    -r MATLAB_command    - Start MATLAB and execute the MATLAB_command.
    -logfile log         - Make a copy of any output to the command window
                           in file log. This includes all crash reports.
    -timing              - Print a summary of startup time to the command
                           window. It is also recorded in a timing log, the
                           name of which is printed to the shell window that
                           started up MATLAB.
    -Ddebugger [options] - Start debugger to debug MATLAB.
