TLS debug client.  It sets up multiple TLS connections to a server and
queries its capabilities.  It was created to assist in debugging GnuTLS,
but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capabilities.  It connects
to a TLS server, performs tests and print the server's capabilities.  If
called with the `-v' parameter more checks will be performed.  Can be used
to check for servers with special needs or bugs.
