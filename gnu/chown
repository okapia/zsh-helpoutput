Usage: chown [OPTION]... OWNER[:[GROUP]] FILE...
  or:  chown [OPTION]... :GROUP FILE...
  or:  chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.
With --reference, change the owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

  -c, --changes          like verbose but report only when a change is made
      --dereference      affect the referent of each symbolic link, rather
                         than the symbolic link itself (this is the default)
  -h, --no-dereference   affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced
                         file (useful only on systems that can change the
                         ownership of a symlink)
      --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
                         change the owner and/or group of each file only if
                         its current owner and/or group match those specified
                         here.  Either may be omitted, in which case a match
                         is not required for the omitted attribute.
      --no-preserve-root do not treat `/' specially (the default)
      --preserve-root    fail to operate recursively on `/'
  -f, --silent, --quiet  suppress most error messages
      --reference=RFILE  use RFILE's owner and group rather than
                         the specifying OWNER:GROUP values
  -R, --recursive        operate on files and directories recursively
  -v, --verbose          output a diagnostic for every file processed

The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R
option is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final
one takes effect.

  -H                     if a command line argument is a symbolic link
                         to a directory, traverse it
  -L                     traverse every symbolic link to a directory
                         encountered
  -P                     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed
to login group if implied by a `:'.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well
as symbolic.
