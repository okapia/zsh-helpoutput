recover: usage: svnadmin recover REPOS_PATH

Run the recovery procedure on a repository.  Do this if you've
been getting errors indicating that recovery ought to be run.

exit if the repository is in use by another process.

Valid options:
  --wait                   : wait instead of exit if the repository is in
                             use by another process
