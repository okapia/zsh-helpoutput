recover: usage: svnadmin recover REPOS_PATH

Run the Berkeley DB recovery procedure on a repository.  Do
this if you've been getting errors indicating that recovery
ought to be run.  Recovery requires exclusive access and will
exit if the repository is in use by another process.


Valid options:
  --wait                   : wait instead of exit if the repository is in
                             use by another process
