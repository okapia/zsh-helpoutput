unlock: usage: svnadmin unlock REPOS_PATH LOCKED_PATH USERNAME TOKEN

Unlock LOCKED_PATH (as USERNAME) after verifying that the token
associated with the lock matches TOKEN.  Use --bypass-hooks to avoid
triggering the pre-unlock and post-unlock hook scripts.

Valid options:
  --bypass-hooks           : bypass the repository hook system
  -q [--quiet]             : no progress (only errors to stderr)
