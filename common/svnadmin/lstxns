lstxns: usage: svnadmin lstxns REPOS_PATH

Print the names of uncommitted transactions. With -rN skip the output
of those that have a base revision more recent than rN.  Transactions
with base revisions much older than HEAD are likely to have been
abandonded and are candidates to be removed.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : transaction base revision ARG
