setlog: usage: svnadmin setlog REPOS_PATH -r REVISION FILE

Set the log-message on revision REVISION to the contents of FILE.  Use
--bypass-hooks to avoid triggering the revision-property-related hooks
(for example, if you do not want an email notification sent
from your post-revprop-change hook, or because the modification of
revision properties has not been enabled in the pre-revprop-change
hook).

NOTE: Revision properties are not versioned, so this command will
overwrite the previous log message.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : specify revision number ARG (or X:Y range)
  --bypass-hooks           : bypass the repository hook system
