pack: usage: svnadmin pack REPOS_PATH

Possibly compact the repository into a more efficient storage model.
This may not apply to all repositories, in which case, exit.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : no progress (only errors to stderr)
  -M [--memory-cache-size] ARG : size of the extra in-memory cache in MB used to
                             minimize redundant operations. Default: 16.
                             [used for FSFS repositories only]
