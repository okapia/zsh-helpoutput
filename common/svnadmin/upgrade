upgrade: usage: svnadmin upgrade REPOS_PATH

Upgrade the repository located at REPOS_PATH to the latest supported
schema version.

This functionality is provided as a convenience for repository
administrators who wish to make use of new Subversion functionality
without having to undertake a potentially costly full repository dump
and load operation.  As such, the upgrade performs only the minimum
amount of work needed to accomplish this while still maintaining the
integrity of the repository.  It does not guarantee the most optimized
repository state as a dump and subsequent load would.
