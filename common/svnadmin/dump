dump: usage: svnadmin dump REPOS_PATH [-r LOWER[:UPPER] [--incremental]]

Dump the contents of filesystem to stdout in a 'dumpfile'
portable format, sending feedback to stderr.  Dump revisions
LOWER rev through UPPER rev.  If no revisions are given, dump all
revision trees.  If only LOWER is given, dump that one revision tree.
If --incremental is passed, the first revision dumped will describe
only the paths changed in that revision; otherwise it will describe
every path present in the repository as of that revision.  (In either
case, the second and subsequent revisions, if any, describe only paths
changed in those revisions.)

Using --exclude or --include gives results equivalent to authz-based
path exclusions. In particular, when the source of a copy is
excluded, the copy is transformed into an add (unlike in 'svndumpfilter').

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : specify revision number ARG (or X:Y range)
  --incremental            : dump or hotcopy incrementally
  --deltas                 : use deltas in dump output
  -q [--quiet]             : no progress (only errors to stderr)
  -M [--memory-cache-size] ARG : size of the extra in-memory cache in MB used to
                             minimize redundant operations. Default: 16.
                             [used for FSFS repositories only]
  -F [--file] ARG          : write to file ARG instead of stdout
  --exclude ARG            : filter out nodes with given prefix(es) from dump
  --include ARG            : filter out nodes without given prefix(es) from dump
  --pattern                : treat the path prefixes as file glob patterns.
                             Glob special characters are '*' '?' '[]' and '\'.
                             Character '/' is not treated specially, so
                             pattern /*/foo matches paths /a/foo and /a/b/foo.
