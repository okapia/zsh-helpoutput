load: usage: svnadmin load REPOS_PATH

Read a 'dumpfile'-formatted stream from stdin, committing
new revisions into the repository's filesystem.  If the repository
was previously empty, its UUID will, by default, be changed to the
one specified in the stream.  Progress feedback is sent to stdout.
If --revision is specified, limit the loaded revisions to only those
in the dump stream whose revision numbers match the specified range.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : no progress (only errors to stderr)
  -r [--revision] ARG      : specify revision number ARG (or X:Y range)
  --ignore-uuid            : ignore any repos UUID found in the stream
  --force-uuid             : set repos UUID to that found in stream, if any
  --ignore-dates           : ignore revision datestamps found in the stream
  --use-pre-commit-hook    : call pre-commit hook before committing revisions
  --use-post-commit-hook   : call post-commit hook after committing revisions
  --parent-dir ARG         : load at specified directory in repository
  --normalize-props        : normalize property values found in the dumpstream
                             (currently, only translates non-LF line endings)
  --bypass-prop-validation : bypass property validation logic
  -M [--memory-cache-size] ARG : size of the extra in-memory cache in MB used to
                             minimize redundant operations. Default: 16.
                             [used for FSFS repositories only]
  --no-flush-to-disk       : disable flushing to disk during the operation
                             (faster, but unsafe on power off)
  -F [--file] ARG          : read from file ARG instead of stdin
