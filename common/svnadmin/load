load: usage: svnadmin load REPOS_PATH

Read a 'dumpfile'-formatted stream from stdin, committing
new revisions into the repository's filesystem.  If the repository
was previously empty, its UUID will, by default, be changed to the
one specified in the stream.  Progress feedback is sent to stdout.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : no progress (only errors) to stderr
  --ignore-uuid            : ignore any repos UUID found in the stream
  --force-uuid             : set repos UUID to that found in stream, if any
  --parent-dir arg         : load at specified directory in repository
