  Summary:
    Manage the sources and cache file RubyGems uses to search for gems

  Description:
    RubyGems fetches gems from the sources you have configured (stored in your
    ~/.gemrc).
    
    The default source is https://rubygems.org, but you may have other sources
    configured.  This guide will help you update your sources or configure
    yourself to use your own gem server.
    
    Without any arguments the sources lists your currently configured sources:
    
      $ gem sources
      *** CURRENT SOURCES ***
    
      https://rubygems.org
    
    This may list multiple sources or non-rubygems sources.  You probably
    configured them before or have an old `~/.gemrc`.  If you have sources you
    do not recognize you should remove them.
    
    RubyGems has been configured to serve gems via the following URLs through
    its history:
    
    * http://gems.rubyforge.org (RubyGems 1.3.6 and earlier)
    * http://rubygems.org       (RubyGems 1.3.7 through 1.8.25)
    * https://rubygems.org      (RubyGems 2.0.1 and newer)
    
    Since all of these sources point to the same set of gems you only need one
    of them in your list.  https://rubygems.org is recommended as it brings the
    protections of an SSL connection to gem downloads.
    
    To add a source use the --add argument:
    
        $ gem sources --add https://rubygems.org
        https://rubygems.org added to sources
    
    RubyGems will check to see if gems can be installed from the source given
    before it is added.
    
    To remove a source use the --remove argument:
    
        $ gem sources --remove http://rubygems.org
        http://rubygems.org removed from sources

  Defaults:
    --list
