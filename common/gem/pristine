  Arguments:
    GEMNAME       gem to restore to pristine condition (unless --all)

  Summary:
    Restores installed gems to pristine condition from files located in the gem
    cache

  Description:
    The pristine command compares an installed gem with the contents of its
    cached .gem file and restores any files that don't match the cached .gem's
    copy.
    
    If you have made modifications to an installed gem, the pristine command
    will revert them.  All extensions are rebuilt and all bin stubs for the gem
    are regenerated after checking for modifications.
    
    If the cached gem cannot be found it will be downloaded.
    
    If --no-extensions is provided pristine will not attempt to restore a gem
    with an extension.
    
    If --extensions is given (but not --all or gem names) only gems with
    extensions will be restored.

  Defaults:
    --extensions
