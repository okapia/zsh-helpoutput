rclone cat sends any files to standard output.

You can use it like this to output a single file

    rclone cat remote:path/to/file

Or like this to output any file in dir or subdirectories.

    rclone cat remote:path/to/dir

Or like this to output any .txt files in dir or subdirectories.

    rclone --include "*.txt" cat remote:path/to/dir

Use the --head flag to print characters only at the start, --tail for
the end and --offset and --count to print a section in the middle.
Note that if offset is negative it will count from the end, so
--offset -1 --count 1 is equivalent to --tail 1.

Usage:
  rclone cat remote:path [flags]

Flags:
      --count int    Only print N characters. (default -1)
      --discard      Discard the output instead of printing.
      --head int     Only print the first N characters.
  -h, --help         help for cat
      --offset int   Start printing at offset N (or from end if -ve).
      --tail int     Only print the last N characters.
