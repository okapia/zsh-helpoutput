Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination
directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and
the remote does not support a server side directory move operation.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server side move
`source:path` into `dest:path`. After this `source:path` will no
longer longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in `source:path` selected by the filters (if
any) this will move it into `dest:path`.  If possible a server side
move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server side if possible)
into `dest:path` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in
`source:path`.

If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the --delete-empty-src-dirs flag.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
--dry-run flag.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

Usage:
  rclone move source:path dest:path [flags]

Flags:
      --delete-empty-src-dirs   Delete empty source dirs after move
  -h, --help                    help for move
