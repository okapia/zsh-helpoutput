Copy the source to the destination.  Doesn't transfer
unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or
MD5SUM.  Doesn't delete files from the destination.

Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced,
not the directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the
contents of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and
contents.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

For example

    rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath

Let's say there are two files in sourcepath

    sourcepath/one.txt
    sourcepath/two.txt

This copies them to

    destpath/one.txt
    destpath/two.txt

Not to

    destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
    destpath/sourcepath/two.txt

If you are familiar with `rsync`, rclone always works as if you had
written a trailing / - meaning "copy the contents of this directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.

See the [--no-traverse](/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.  Supplying this
option when copying a small number of files into a large destination
can speed transfers up greatly.

For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can to copy all the files which have
changed recently very efficiently like this:

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics

Usage:
  rclone copy source:path dest:path [flags]

Flags:
      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after copy
  -h, --help                    help for copy

Use "rclone [command] --help" for more information about a command.
Use "rclone help flags" for to see the global flags.
Use "rclone help backends" for a list of supported services.
