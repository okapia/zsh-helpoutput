This runs a command against a running rclone.  Use the --url flag to
specify an non default URL to connect on.  This can be either a
":port" which is taken to mean "http://localhost:port" or a
"host:port" which is taken to mean "http://host:port"

A username and password can be passed in with --user and --pass.

Note that --rc-addr, --rc-user, --rc-pass will be read also for --url,
--user, --pass.

Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.

The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.

The --json parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input
instead of key=value arguments.  This is the only way of passing in
more complicated values.

Use --loopback to connect to the rclone instance running "rclone rc".
This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an
rclone rc server, eg:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/

Use "rclone rc" to see a list of all possible commands.
