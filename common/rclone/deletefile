Remove a single file from remote.  Unlike `delete` it cannot be used to
remove a directory and it doesn't obey include/exclude filters - if the specified file exists,
it will always be removed.

Usage:
  rclone deletefile remote:path [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for deletefile

Use "rclone [command] --help" for more information about a command.
