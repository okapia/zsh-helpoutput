Lists the objects in the source path to standard output in a human
readable format with modification time, size and path. Recurses by default.

Eg

    $ rclone lsl swift:bucket
        60295 2016-06-25 18:55:41.062626927 bevajer5jef

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this commmand.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use "--max-depth 1" to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use "-R" to make them recurse.

Listing a non existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (eg s3, swift, gcs, etc -
the bucket based remotes).

Usage:
  rclone lsl remote:path [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for lsl

Use "rclone [command] --help" for more information about a command.
Use "rclone help flags" for to see the global flags.
Use "rclone help backends" for a list of supported services.
