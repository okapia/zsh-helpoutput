This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.

This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.

If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory
for GET requests on the URL passed in.  It will also open the URL in
the browser when rclone is run.

See the [rc documentation](/rc/) for more info on the rc flags.

Usage:
  rclone rcd <path to files to serve>* [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for rcd

Use "rclone [command] --help" for more information about a command.
Use "rclone help flags" for to see the global flags.
Use "rclone help backends" for a list of supported services.
