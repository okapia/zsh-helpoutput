checkout (co): Check out a working copy from a repository.
usage: checkout URL[@REV]... [PATH]

  If specified, REV determines in which revision the URL is first
  looked up.

  If PATH is omitted, the basename of the URL will be used as
  the destination. If multiple URLs are given each will be checked
  out into a sub-directory of PATH, with the name of the sub-directory
  being the basename of the URL.

  If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working
  copy destination do not automatically cause the check out to fail.
  If the obstructing path is the same type (file or directory) as the
  corresponding path in the repository it becomes versioned but its
  contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.  This means that an
  obstructing directory's unversioned children may also obstruct and
  become versioned.  For files, any content differences between the
  obstruction and the repository are treated like a local modification
  to the working copy.  All properties from the repository are applied
  to the obstructing path.

  See also 'svn help update' for a list of possible characters
  reporting the action taken.
