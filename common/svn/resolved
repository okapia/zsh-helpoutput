resolved: Remove 'conflicted' state on working copy files or directories.
usage: resolved PATH...

  Note:  this subcommand does not semantically resolve conflicts or
  remove conflict markers; it merely removes the conflict-related
  artifact files and allows PATH to be committed again.

Valid options:
  --targets arg            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -R [--recursive]         : descend recursively
  -q [--quiet]             : print as little as possible
  --config-dir arg         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
