export: Create an unversioned copy of a tree.
usage: 1. export [-r REV] URL[@PEGREV] [PATH]
       2. export [-r REV] PATH1[@PEGREV] [PATH2]

  1. Exports a clean directory tree from the repository specified by
     URL, at revision REV if it is given, otherwise at HEAD, into
     PATH. If PATH is omitted, the last component of the URL is used
     for the local directory name.

  2. Exports a clean directory tree from the working copy specified by
     PATH1, at revision REV if it is given, otherwise at WORKING, into
     PATH2.  If PATH2 is omitted, the last component of the PATH1 is used
     for the local directory name. If REV is not specified, all local
     changes will be preserved, but files not under version control will
     not be copied.

  If specified, PEGREV determines in which revision the target is first
  looked up.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
