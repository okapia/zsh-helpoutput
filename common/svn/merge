merge: Apply the differences between two sources to a working copy path.
usage: 1. merge sourceURL1[@N] sourceURL2[@M] [WCPATH]
       2. merge sourceWCPATH1@N sourceWCPATH2@M [WCPATH]
       3. merge [-c M[,N...] | -r N:M ...] SOURCE[@REV] [WCPATH]

  1. In the first form, the source URLs are specified at revisions
     N and M.  These are the two sources to be compared.  The revisions
     default to HEAD if omitted.

  2. In the second form, the URLs corresponding to the source working
     copy paths define the sources to be compared.  The revisions must
     be specified.

  3. In the third form, SOURCE can be either a URL or a working copy
     path (in which case its corresponding URL is used).  SOURCE (in
     revision REV) is compared as it existed between revisions N and M
     for each revision range provided.  If REV is not specified, HEAD
     is assumed.  '-c M' is equivalent to '-r <M-1>:M', and '-c -M'
     does the reverse: '-r M:<M-1>'.  If no revision ranges are
     specified, the default range of 0:REV is used.  Multiple '-c'
     and/or '-r' options may be specified, and mixing of forward
     and reverse ranges is allowed.

  WCPATH is the working copy path that will receive the changes.
  If WCPATH is omitted, a default value of '.' is assumed, unless
  the sources have identical basenames that match a file within '.':
  in which case, the differences will be applied to that file.

  NOTE:  Subversion will only record metadata to track the merge
  if the two sources are on the same line of history -- if the
  first source is an ancestor of the second, or vice-versa.  This is
  guaranteed to be the case when using the third form listed above.
  The --ignore-ancestry option overrides this, forcing Subversion to
  regard the sources as unrelated and not to track the merge.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -c [--change] ARG        : the change made by revision ARG (like -r ARG-1:ARG)
                             If ARG is negative this is like -r ARG:ARG-1
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                            'immediates', or 'infinity')
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --dry-run                : try operation but make no changes
  --diff3-cmd ARG          : use ARG as merge command
  --record-only            : mark revisions as merged (use with -r)
  -x [--extensions] ARG    : Default: '-u'. When Subversion is invoking an
                             external diff program, ARG is simply passed along
                             to the program. But when Subversion is using its
                             default internal diff implementation, or when
                             Subversion is displaying blame annotations, ARG
                             could be any of the following:
                                -u (--unified):
                                   Output 3 lines of unified context.
                                -b (--ignore-space-change):
                                   Ignore changes in the amount of white space.
                                -w (--ignore-all-space):
                                   Ignore all white space.
                                --ignore-eol-style:
                                   Ignore changes in EOL style.
                                -p (--show-c-function):
                                   Show C function name in diff output.
  --ignore-ancestry        : ignore ancestry when calculating merges
  --accept ARG             : specify automatic conflict resolution action
                            ('postpone', 'base', 'mine-conflict',
                             'theirs-conflict', 'mine-full', 'theirs-full',
                             'edit', 'launch')
  --reintegrate            : lump-merge all of source URL's unmerged changes

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --trust-server-cert      : accept unknown SSL server certificates without
                             prompting (but only with '--non-interactive')
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
