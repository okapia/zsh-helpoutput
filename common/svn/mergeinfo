mergeinfo: Display merge-related information.
usage: 1. mergeinfo SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET[@REV]]
       2. mergeinfo --show-revs=WHICH SOURCE[@REV] [TARGET[@REV]]

  1. Summarize the history of merging between SOURCE and TARGET. The graph
     shows, from left to right:
       the youngest common ancestor of the branches;
       the latest full merge in either direction, and thus the common base
         that will be used for the next complete merge;
       the repository path and revision number of the tip of each branch.

  2. Print the revision numbers on SOURCE that have been merged to TARGET
     (with --show-revs=merged), or that have not been merged to TARGET
     (with --show-revs=eligible). Print only revisions in which there was
     at least one change in SOURCE.

     If --revision (-r) is provided, filter the displayed information to
     show only that which is associated with the revisions within the
     specified range.  Revision numbers, dates, and the 'HEAD' keyword are
     valid range values.

  SOURCE and TARGET are the source and target branch URLs, respectively.
  (If a WC path is given, the corresponding base URL is used.) The default
  TARGET is the current working directory ('.'). REV specifies the revision
  to be considered the tip of the branch; the default for SOURCE is HEAD,
  and the default for TARGET is HEAD for a URL or BASE for a WC path.

  The depth can be 'empty' or 'infinity'; the default is 'empty'.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -R [--recursive]         : descend recursively, same as --depth=infinity
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -v [--verbose]           : print extra information
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  --show-revs ARG          : specify which collection of revisions to display
                             ('merged', 'eligible')
  --log                    : show revision log message, author and date
  --incremental            : give output suitable for concatenation

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG (caution: on many operating
                             systems, other users will be able to see this)
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting (default is to prompt
                             only if standard input is a terminal device)
  --force-interactive      : do interactive prompting even if standard input
                             is not a terminal device
  --trust-server-cert      : deprecated; same as
                             --trust-server-cert-failures=unknown-ca
  --trust-server-cert-failures ARG : with --non-interactive, accept SSL server
                             certificates with failures; ARG is comma-separated
                             list of 'unknown-ca' (Unknown Authority),
                             'cn-mismatch' (Hostname mismatch), 'expired'
                             (Expired certificate), 'not-yet-valid' (Not yet
                             valid certificate) and 'other' (all other not
                             separately classified certificate errors).
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
