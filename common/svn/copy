copy (cp): Duplicate something in working copy or repository, remembering
history.
usage: copy SRC[@REV]... DST

When copying multiple sources, they will be added as children of DST,
which must be a directory.

  SRC and DST can each be either a working copy (WC) path or URL:
    WC  -> WC:   copy and schedule for addition (with history)
    WC  -> URL:  immediately commit a copy of WC to URL
    URL -> WC:   check out URL into WC, schedule for addition
    URL -> URL:  complete server-side copy;  used to branch and tag
  All the SRCs must be of the same type.

WARNING: For compatibility with previous versions of Subversion,
copies performed using two working copy paths (WC -> WC) will not
contact the repository.  As such, they may not, by default, be able
to propagate merge tracking information from the source of the copy
to the destination.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:

                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date

                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --parents                : make intermediate directories
  -m [--message] ARG       : specify log message ARG
  -F [--file] ARG          : read log message from file ARG
  --force-log              : force validity of log message source
