move (mv, rename, ren): Move (rename) an item in a working copy or repository.
usage: move SRC... DST

  SRC and DST can both be working copy (WC) paths or URLs:
    WC  -> WC:  move an item in a working copy, as a local change to
                be committed later (with or without further changes)
    URL -> URL: move an item in the repository directly, immediately
                creating a new revision in the repository
  All the SRCs must be of the same type. When moving multiple sources,
  they will be added as children of DST, which must be a directory.

  SRC and DST of WC -> WC moves must be committed in the same revision.
  Furthermore, WC -> WC moves will refuse to move a mixed-revision subtree.
  To avoid unnecessary conflicts, it is recommended to run 'svn update'
  to update the subtree to a single revision before moving it.
  The --allow-mixed-revisions option is provided for backward compatibility.

  The --revision option has no use and is deprecated.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --parents                : make intermediate directories
  --allow-mixed-revisions  : Allow operation on mixed-revision working copy.
                             Use of this option is not recommended!
                             Please run 'svn update' instead.
  -m [--message] ARG       : specify log message ARG
  -F [--file] ARG          : read log message from file ARG
  --force-log              : force validity of log message source
  --editor-cmd ARG         : use ARG as external editor
  --encoding ARG           : treat value as being in charset encoding ARG
  --with-revprop ARG       : set revision property ARG in new revision
                             using the name[=value] format

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG (caution: on many operating
                             systems, other users will be able to see this)
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting (default is to prompt
                             only if standard input is a terminal device)
  --force-interactive      : do interactive prompting even if standard input
                             is not a terminal device
  --trust-server-cert      : deprecated; same as
                             --trust-server-cert-failures=unknown-ca
  --trust-server-cert-failures ARG : with --non-interactive, accept SSL server
                             certificates with failures; ARG is comma-separated
                             list of 'unknown-ca' (Unknown Authority),
                             'cn-mismatch' (Hostname mismatch), 'expired'
                             (Expired certificate), 'not-yet-valid' (Not yet
                             valid certificate) and 'other' (all other not
                             separately classified certificate errors).
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
