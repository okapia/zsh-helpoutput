status (stat, st): Print the status of working copy files and directories.
usage: status [PATH...]

  With no args, print only locally modified items (no network access).
  With -q, print only summary information about locally modified items.
  With -u, add working revision and server out-of-date information.
  With -v, print full revision information on every item.

  The first seven columns in the output are each one character wide:
    First column: Says if item was added, deleted, or otherwise changed
      ' ' no modifications
      'A' Added
      'C' Conflicted
      'D' Deleted
      'I' Ignored
      'M' Modified
      'R' Replaced
      'X' an unversioned directory created by an externals definition
      '?' item is not under version control
      '!' item is missing (removed by non-svn command) or incomplete
      '~' versioned item obstructed by some item of a different kind
    Second column: Modifications of a file's or directory's properties
      ' ' no modifications
      'C' Conflicted
      'M' Modified
    Third column: Whether the working copy is locked for writing by
                  another Subversion client modifying the working copy
      ' ' not locked for writing
      'L' locked for writing
    Fourth column: Scheduled commit will create a copy (addition-with-history)
      ' ' no history scheduled with commit (item was newly added)
      '+' history scheduled with commit (item was copied)
    Fifth column: Whether the item is switched or a file external
      ' ' normal
      'S' the item has a Switched URL relative to the parent
      'X' a versioned file created by an eXternals definition
    Sixth column: Whether the item is locked in repository for exclusive commit
      (without -u)
      ' ' not locked by this working copy
      'K' locked by this working copy, but lock might be stolen or broken
      (with -u)
      ' ' not locked in repository, not locked by this working copy
      'K' locked in repository, lock owned by this working copy
      'O' locked in repository, lock owned by another working copy
      'T' locked in repository, lock owned by this working copy was stolen
      'B' not locked in repository, lock owned by this working copy is broken
    Seventh column: Whether the item is the victim of a tree conflict
      ' ' normal
      'C' tree-Conflicted
    If the item is a tree conflict victim, an additional line is printed
    after the item's status line, explaining the nature of the conflict.

  The out-of-date information appears in the ninth column (with -u):
      '*' a newer revision exists on the server
      ' ' the working copy is up to date

  Remaining fields are variable width and delimited by spaces:
    The working revision (with -u or -v; '-' if the item is copied)
    The last committed revision and last committed author (with -v)
    The working copy path is always the final field, so it can
      include spaces.

  The presence of a question mark ('?') where a working revision, last
  committed revision, or last committed author was expected indicates
  that the information is unknown or irrelevant given the state of the
  item (for example, when the item is the result of a copy operation).
  The question mark serves as a visual placeholder to facilitate parsing.

  Example output:
    svn status wc
     M      wc/bar.c
    A  +    wc/qax.c

    svn status -u wc
     M             965   wc/bar.c
            *      965   wc/foo.c
    A  +             -   wc/qax.c
    Status against revision:   981

    svn status --show-updates --verbose wc
