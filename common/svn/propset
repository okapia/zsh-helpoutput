propset (pset, ps): Set the value of a property on files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. propset PROPNAME PROPVAL PATH...
       2. propset PROPNAME --revprop -r REV PROPVAL [TARGET]

  1. Changes a versioned file or directory property in a working copy.
  2. Changes an unversioned property on a repository revision.
     (TARGET only determines which repository to access.)

  The value may be provided with the --file option instead of PROPVAL.

  Note: svn recognizes the following special versioned properties
  but will store any arbitrary properties set:
    svn:ignore     - A newline separated list of file glob patterns to ignore.
    svn:keywords   - Keywords to be expanded.  Valid keywords are:
      URL, HeadURL             - The URL for the head version of the object.
      Author, LastChangedBy    - The last person to modify the file.
      Date, LastChangedDate    - The date/time the object was last modified.
      Rev, Revision,           - The last revision the object changed.
      LastChangedRevision
      Id                       - A compressed summary of the previous
                                   4 keywords.
      Header                   - Similar to Id but includes the full URL.
    svn:executable - If present, make the file executable.  Use
      'svn propdel svn:executable PATH...' to clear.
    svn:eol-style  - One of 'native', 'LF', 'CR', 'CRLF'.
    svn:mime-type  - The mimetype of the file.  Used to determine
      whether to merge the file, and how to serve it from Apache.
      A mimetype beginning with 'text/' (or an absent mimetype) is
      treated as text.  Anything else is treated as binary.
    svn:externals  - A newline separated list of module specifiers,
      each of which consists of a URL and a relative directory path,
      similar to the syntax of the 'svn checkout' command:
        http://example.com/repos/zig foo/bar
      A revision to check out can optionally be specified to pin the
      external to a known revision:
        -r25 http://example.com/repos/zig foo/bar
      To unambiguously identify an element at a path which has been
      deleted (possibly even deleted multiple times in its history),
      an optional peg revision can be appended to the URL:
        -r25 http://example.com/repos/zig@42 foo/bar
      Relative URLs are indicated by starting the URL with one
      of the following strings:
        ../  to the parent directory of the extracted external
        ^/   to the repository root
        //   to the scheme
        /    to the server root
      The ambiguous format 'relative_path relative_path' is taken as
      'relative_url relative_path' with peg revision support.
      Lines in externals definitions starting with the '#' character
      are considered comments and are ignored.
      Subversion 1.4 and earlier only support the following formats
      where peg revisions can only be specified using a -r modifier
      and where URLs cannot be relative:
        foo             http://example.com/repos/zig
        foo/bar -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag
      Use of these formats is discouraged. They should only be used if
      interoperability with 1.4 clients is desired.
    svn:needs-lock - If present, indicates that the file should be locked
      before it is modified.  Makes the working copy file read-only
      when it is not locked.  Use 'svn propdel svn:needs-lock PATH...'
      to clear.

  The svn:keywords, svn:executable, svn:eol-style, svn:mime-type and
  svn:needs-lock properties cannot be set on a directory.  A non-recursive
  attempt will fail, and a recursive attempt will set the property
  only on the file children of the directory.

Valid options:
  -F [--file] ARG          : read property value from file ARG
  --encoding ARG           : treat value as being in charset encoding ARG
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  --targets ARG            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -R [--recursive]         : descend recursively, same as --depth=infinity
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  --revprop                : operate on a revision property (use with -r)
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --changelist [--cl] ARG  : operate only on members of changelist ARG

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --trust-server-cert      : accept SSL server certificates from unknown
                             certificate authorities without prompting (but only
                             with '--non-interactive')
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
