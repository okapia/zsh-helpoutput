propset (pset, ps): Set PROPNAME to PROPVAL on files, dirs, or revisions.
usage: 1. propset PROPNAME [PROPVAL | -F VALFILE] PATH...
       2. propset PROPNAME --revprop -r REV [PROPVAL | -F VALFILE] [URL]

  1. Creates a versioned, local propchange in working copy.
  2. Creates an unversioned, remote propchange on repos revision.

  Note: svn recognizes the following special versioned properties
  but will store any arbitrary properties set:
    svn:ignore     - A newline separated list of file patterns to ignore.
    svn:keywords   - Keywords to be expanded.  Valid keywords are:
      URL, HeadURL             - The URL for the head version of the object.
      Author, LastChangedBy    - The last person to modify the file.
      Date, LastChangedDate    - The date/time the object was last modified.
      Rev, Revision,           - The last revision the object changed.
      LastChangedRevision
      Id                       - A compressed summary of the previous
                                   4 keywords.
    svn:executable - If present, make the file executable. This
      property cannot be set on a directory.  A non-recursive attempt
      will fail, and a recursive attempt will set the property only
      on the file children of the directory.
    svn:eol-style  - One of 'native', 'LF', 'CR', 'CRLF'.
    svn:mime-type  - The mimetype of the file.  Used to determine
      whether to merge the file, and how to serve it from Apache.
      A mimetype beginning with 'text/' (or an absent mimetype) is
      treated as text.  Anything else is treated as binary.
    svn:externals  - A newline separated list of module specifiers,
      each of which consists of a relative directory path, optional
      revision flags, and an URL.  For example
        foo             http://example.com/repos/zig
        foo/bar -r 1234 http://example.com/repos/zag

Valid options:
  -F [--file] arg          : read data from file ARG
  -q [--quiet]             : print as little as possible
  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                "{" DATE "}" revision at start of the date
                                "HEAD"       latest in repository
                                "BASE"       base rev of item's working copy
                                "COMMITTED"  last commit at or before BASE
                                "PREV"       revision just before COMMITTED
  --targets arg            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -R [--recursive]         : descend recursively
  --revprop                : operate on a revision property (use with -r)
  --username arg           : specify a username ARG
  --password arg           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --encoding arg           : treat value as being in charset encoding ARG
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --config-dir arg         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
