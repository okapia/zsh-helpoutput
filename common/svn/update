update (up): Bring changes from the repository into the working copy.
usage: update [PATH...]

  If no revision given, bring working copy up-to-date with HEAD rev.
  Else synchronize working copy to revision given by -r.

  For each updated item a line will start with a character reporting the
  action taken.  These characters have the following meaning:

    A  Added
    D  Deleted
    U  Updated
    C  Conflict
    G  Merged

  A character in the first column signifies an update to the actual file,
  while updates to the file's properties are shown in the second column.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                "{" DATE "}" revision at start of the date
                                "HEAD"       latest in repository

                                "PREV"       revision just before COMMITTED
