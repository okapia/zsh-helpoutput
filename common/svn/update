update (up): Bring changes from the repository into the working copy.
usage: update [PATH...]

  If no revision is given, bring working copy up-to-date with HEAD rev.
  Else synchronize working copy to revision given by -r.

  For each updated item a line will start with a character reporting the
  action taken.  These characters have the following meaning:

    A  Added
    D  Deleted
    U  Updated
    C  Conflict
    G  Merged
    E  Existed

  A character in the first column signifies an update to the actual file,
  while updates to the file's properties are shown in the second column.
  A 'B' in the third column signifies that the lock for the file has
  been broken or stolen.

  If --force is used, unversioned obstructing paths in the working
  copy do not automatically cause a failure if the update attempts to
  add the same path.  If the obstructing path is the same type (file
  or directory) as the corresponding path in the repository it becomes
  versioned but its contents are left 'as-is' in the working copy.
  This means that an obstructing directory's unversioned children may
  also obstruct and become versioned.  For files, any content differences
  between the obstruction and the repository are treated like a local
  modification to the working copy.  All properties from the repository
  are applied to the obstructing path.  Obstructing paths are reported
  in the first column with code 'E'.

  Use the --set-depth option to set a new working copy depth on the
  targets of this operation.

  --set-depth ARG          : set new working copy depth to ARG ('exclude',
                            'empty', 'files', 'immediates', or 'infinity')
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information

  --editor-cmd ARG         : use ARG as external editor
  --accept ARG             : specify automatic conflict resolution action
                            ('postpone', 'base', 'mine-conflict',
