diff (di): Display the differences between two revisions or paths.
usage: 1. diff [-c M | -r N[:M]] [TARGET[@REV]...]
       2. diff [-r N[:M]] --old=OLD-TGT[@OLDREV] [--new=NEW-TGT[@NEWREV]] \
               [PATH...]
       3. diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]

  1. Display the changes made to TARGETs as they are seen in REV between
     two revisions.  TARGETs may be all working copy paths or all URLs.
     If TARGETs are working copy paths, N defaults to BASE and M to the
     working copy; if URLs, N must be specified and M defaults to HEAD.
     The '-c M' option is equivalent to '-r N:M' where N = M-1.
     Using '-c -M' does the reverse: '-r M:N' where N = M-1.

  2. Display the differences between OLD-TGT as it was seen in OLDREV and
     NEW-TGT as it was seen in NEWREV.  PATHs, if given, are relative to
     OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT and restrict the output to differences for those
     paths.  OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT may be working copy paths or URL[@REV].
     NEW-TGT defaults to OLD-TGT if not specified.  -r N makes OLDREV default
     to N, -r N:M makes OLDREV default to N and NEWREV default to M.

  3. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-URL[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-URL[@NEWREV]'

  Use just 'svn diff' to display local modifications in a working copy.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -c [--change] ARG        : the change made by revision ARG (like -r ARG-1:ARG)
                             If ARG is negative this is like -r ARG:ARG-1
  --old ARG                : use ARG as the older target
  --new ARG                : use ARG as the newer target
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  --diff-cmd ARG           : use ARG as diff command
  --internal-diff          : override diff-cmd specified in config file
  -x [--extensions] ARG    : Default: '-u'. When Subversion is invoking an
                             external diff program, ARG is simply passed along
                             to the program. But when Subversion is using its
                             default internal diff implementation, or when
                             Subversion is displaying blame annotations, ARG
                             could be any of the following:
                                -u (--unified):
                                   Output 3 lines of unified context.
                                -b (--ignore-space-change):
                                   Ignore changes in the amount of white space.
                                -w (--ignore-all-space):
                                   Ignore all white space.
                                --ignore-eol-style:
                                   Ignore changes in EOL style.
                                -p (--show-c-function):
                                   Show C function name in diff output.
  --no-diff-deleted        : do not print differences for deleted files
  --show-copies-as-adds    : don't diff copied or moved files with their source
  --notice-ancestry        : notice ancestry when calculating differences
  --summarize              : show a summary of the results
  --changelist [--cl] ARG  : operate only on members of changelist ARG
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --xml                    : output in XML
  --git                    : use git's extended diff format

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --trust-server-cert      : accept SSL server certificates from unknown
                             certificate authorities without prompting (but only
                             with '--non-interactive')
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
