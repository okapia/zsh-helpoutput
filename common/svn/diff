diff (di): Display local changes or differences between two revisions or paths.
usage: 1. diff
       2. diff [-c M | -r N[:M]] [TARGET[@REV]...]
       3. diff [-r N[:M]] --old=OLD-TGT[@OLDREV] [--new=NEW-TGT[@NEWREV]] \
               [PATH...]
       4. diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]
       5. diff OLD-URL[@OLDREV] NEW-PATH[@NEWREV]
       6. diff OLD-PATH[@OLDREV] NEW-URL[@NEWREV]

  1. Use just 'svn diff' to display local modifications in a working copy.

  2. Display the changes made to TARGETs as they are seen in REV between
     two revisions.  TARGETs may be all working copy paths or all URLs.
     If TARGETs are working copy paths, N defaults to BASE and M to the
     working copy; if URLs, N must be specified and M defaults to HEAD.
     The '-c M' option is equivalent to '-r N:M' where N = M-1.
     Using '-c -M' does the reverse: '-r M:N' where N = M-1.

  3. Display the differences between OLD-TGT as it was seen in OLDREV and
     NEW-TGT as it was seen in NEWREV.  PATHs, if given, are relative to
     OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT and restrict the output to differences for those
     paths.  OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT may be working copy paths or URL[@REV].
     NEW-TGT defaults to OLD-TGT if not specified.  -r N makes OLDREV default
     to N, -r N:M makes OLDREV default to N and NEWREV default to M.
     If OLDREV or NEWREV are not specified, they default to WORKING for
     working copy targets and to HEAD for URL targets.

     Either or both OLD-TGT and NEW-TGT may also be paths to unversioned
     targets. Revisions cannot be specified for unversioned targets.
     Both targets must be of the same node kind (file or directory).
     Diffing unversioned targets against URL targets is not supported.

  4. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-URL[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-URL[@NEWREV]'
  5. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-URL[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-PATH[@NEWREV]'
  6. Shorthand for 'svn diff --old=OLD-PATH[@OLDREV] --new=NEW-URL[@NEWREV]'

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -c [--change] ARG        : the change made by revision ARG (like -r ARG-1:ARG)
                             If ARG is negative this is like -r ARG:ARG-1
                             If ARG is of the form ARG1-ARG2 then this is like
                             ARG1:ARG2, where ARG1 is inclusive
  --old ARG                : use ARG as the older target
  --new ARG                : use ARG as the newer target
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or --depth=immediates
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  --diff-cmd ARG           : use ARG as diff command
  --internal-diff          : override diff-cmd specified in config file
  -x [--extensions] ARG    : Specify differencing options for external diff or
                             internal diff or blame. Default: '-u'. Options are
                             separated by spaces. Internal diff and blame take:
                               -u, --unified: Show 3 lines of unified context
                               -b, --ignore-space-change: Ignore changes in
                                 amount of white space
                               -w, --ignore-all-space: Ignore all white space

  --ignore-properties      : ignore properties during the operation
  --properties-only        : show only properties during the operation
  --show-copies-as-adds    : don't diff copied or moved files with their source

  --changelist [--cl] ARG  : operate only on members of changelist ARG
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --xml                    : output in XML
  --git                    : use git's extended diff format
  --patch-compatible       : generate diff suitable for generic third-party
                             patch tools; currently the same as
                             --show-copies-as-adds --ignore-properties

  --trust-server-cert      : accept SSL server certificates from unknown
                             certificate authorities without prompting (but only
