x-unshelve (unshelve): Bring a shelved change back to a local change in the WC.
usage: 1. x-unshelve [--keep-shelved] [NAME]
       2. x-unshelve --list

  1. Apply the shelved change NAME to the working copy.
     Delete the patch unless the '--keep-shelved' option is given.
     (A backup is kept, named with a '.bak' extension.)
     NAME defaults to the most recent shelved change.

  2. List shelved changes. Include the first line of any log message
     and some details about the contents of the change, unless '-q' is
     given.

  Any conflict between the change being unshelved and a change
  already in the WC is handled the same way as by 'svn patch',
  creating a 'reject' file.

  The shelving feature is EXPERIMENTAL. This command is likely to change
  in the next release, and there is no promise of backward compatibility.

Valid options:
  --keep-shelved           : do not delete the shelved patch
  --list                   : list shelved patches
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --dry-run                : try operation but make no changes

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG (caution: on many operating
                             systems, other users will be able to see this)
  --password-from-stdin    : read password from stdin
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting (default is to prompt
                             only if standard input is a terminal device)
  --force-interactive      : do interactive prompting even if standard input
                             is not a terminal device
  --trust-server-cert      : deprecated; same as
                             --trust-server-cert-failures=unknown-ca
  --trust-server-cert-failures ARG : with --non-interactive, accept SSL server
                             certificates with failures; ARG is comma-separated
                             list of 'unknown-ca' (Unknown Authority),
                             'cn-mismatch' (Hostname mismatch), 'expired'
                             (Expired certificate), 'not-yet-valid' (Not yet
                             valid certificate) and 'other' (all other not
                             separately classified certificate errors).
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
