cleanup: Recursively clean up the working copy, removing write locks, resuming
unfinished operations, etc.
usage: cleanup [WCPATH...]

  Finish any unfinished business in the working copy at WCPATH, and remove
  write locks (shown as 'L' by the 'svn status' command) from the working
  copy. Usually, this is only necessary if a Subversion client has crashed
  while using the working copy, leaving it in an unusable state.

  WARNING: There is no mechanism that will protect write locks still
           being used by other Subversion clients. Running this command
           while another client is using the working copy can corrupt
           the working copy beyond repair!
