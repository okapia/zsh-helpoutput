cleanup: Recursively clean up the working copy, removing write locks, resuming
unfinished operations, etc.
usage: cleanup [WCPATH...]

  By default, finish any unfinished business in the working copy at WCPATH,
  and remove write locks (shown as 'L' by the 'svn status' command) from
  the working copy. Usually, this is only necessary if a Subversion client
  has crashed while using the working copy, leaving it in an unusable state.

  WARNING: There is no mechanism that will protect write locks still
           being used by other Subversion clients. Running this command
           while another client is using the working copy can corrupt
           the working copy beyond repair!

  If the --remove-unversioned option or the --remove-ignored option
  is given, remove any unversioned or ignored items within WCPATH.
  To prevent accidental working copy corruption, unversioned or ignored
  items can only be removed if the working copy is not already locked
  for writing by another Subversion client.
  Note that the 'svn status' command shows unversioned items as '?',
  and ignored items as 'I' if the --no-ignore option is given to it.

Valid options:
  --diff3-cmd ARG          : use ARG as merge command
  --remove-unversioned     : remove unversioned items
  --remove-ignored         : remove ignored items
  --include-externals      : also operate on externals defined by
                             svn:externals properties
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information

Global options:
  --username ARG           : specify a username ARG
  --password ARG           : specify a password ARG (caution: on many operating
                             systems, other users will be able to see this)
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting (default is to prompt
                             only if standard input is a terminal device)
  --force-interactive      : do interactive prompting even if standard input
                             is not a terminal device
  --trust-server-cert      : deprecated; same as
                             --trust-server-cert-failures=unknown-ca
  --trust-server-cert-failures ARG : with --non-interactive, accept SSL server
                             certificates with failures; ARG is comma-separated
                             list of 'unknown-ca' (Unknown Authority),
                             'cn-mismatch' (Hostname mismatch), 'expired'
                             (Expired certificate), 'not-yet-valid' (Not yet
                             valid certificate) and 'other' (all other not
                             separately classified certificate errors).
  --config-dir ARG         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
  --config-option ARG      : set user configuration option in the format:
                                 FILE:SECTION:OPTION=[VALUE]
                             For example:
                                 servers:global:http-library=serf
