NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks install - Install a rock.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks install {<rock>|<name> [<version>]}

DESCRIPTION
	Argument may be the name of a rock to be fetched from a repository
	or a filename of a locally available rock.
	
	--keep              Do not remove previously installed versions of the
	                    rock after installing a new one. This behavior can
	                    be made permanent by setting keep_other_versions=true
	                    in the configuration file.
	
	--only-deps         Installs only the dependencies of the rock.
	--deps-mode=<mode>  How to handle dependencies. Four modes are supported:
	                    * all - use all trees from the rocks_trees list
	                      for finding dependencies
	                    * one - use only the current tree (possibly set
	                      with --tree)
	                    * order - use trees based on order (use the current
	                      tree and all trees below it on the rocks_trees list)
	                    * none - ignore dependencies altogether.
	                    The default mode may be set with the deps_mode entry
	                    in the configuration file.
	                    The current default is "one".
	                    Type '/usr/bin/luarocks' with no arguments to see
	                    your list of rocks trees.
