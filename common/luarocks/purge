NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks purge - Remove all installed rocks from a tree.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks purge --tree=<tree> [--old-versions]

DESCRIPTION
	This command removes rocks en masse from a given tree.
	By default, it removes all rocks from a tree.
	
	The --tree argument is mandatory: luarocks purge does not
	assume a default tree.
	
	--old-versions  Keep the highest-numbered version of each
	                rock and remove the other ones. By default
	                it only removes old versions if they are
	                not needed as dependencies. This can be
	                overridden with the flag --force.
