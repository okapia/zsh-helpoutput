NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks make - Compile package in current directory using a rockspec.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks make [--pack-binary-rock] [<rockspec>]

DESCRIPTION
	Builds sources in the current directory, but unlike "build",
	it does not fetch sources, etc., assuming everything is 
	available in the current directory. If no argument is given,
	it looks for a rockspec in the current directory and in "rockspec/"
	and "rockspecs/" subdirectories, picking the rockspec with newest version
	or without version name. If rockspecs for different rocks are found
	or there are several rockspecs without version, you must specify which to use,
	through the command-line.
	
	This command is useful as a tool for debugging rockspecs. 
	To install rocks, you'll normally want to use the "install" and
	"build" commands. See the help on those for details.
	
	NB: Use `luarocks install` with the `--only-deps` flag if you want to install
	only dependencies of the rockspec (see `luarocks help install`).
	
	--pack-binary-rock  Do not install rock. Instead, produce a .rock file
	                    with the contents of compilation in the current
	                    directory.
	
	--keep              Do not remove previously installed versions of the
	                    rock after installing a new one. This behavior can
	                    be made permanent by setting keep_other_versions=true
	                    in the configuration file.
	
	--branch=<name>     Override the `source.branch` field in the loaded
	                    rockspec. Allows to specify a different branch to 
	                    fetch. Particularly for SCM rocks.
