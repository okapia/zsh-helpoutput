NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks remove - Uninstall a rock.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks remove [--force|--force-fast] <name> [<version>]

DESCRIPTION
	Argument is the name of a rock to be uninstalled.
	If a version is not given, try to remove all versions at once.
	Will only perform the removal if it does not break dependencies.
	To override this check and force the removal, use --force.
	To perform a forced removal without reporting dependency issues,
	use --force-fast.
	
	--deps-mode=<mode>  How to handle dependencies. Four modes are supported:
	                    * all - use all trees from the rocks_trees list
	                      for finding dependencies
	                    * one - use only the current tree (possibly set
	                      with --tree)
	                    * order - use trees based on order (use the current
	                      tree and all trees below it on the rocks_trees list)
	                    * none - ignore dependencies altogether.
	                    The default mode may be set with the deps_mode entry
	                    in the configuration file.
	                    The current default is "one".
	                    Type '/usr/bin/luarocks' with no arguments to see
	                    your list of rocks trees.
