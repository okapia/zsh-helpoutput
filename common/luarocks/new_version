NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks new_version - Auto-write a rockspec for a new version of a rock.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks new_version [--tag=<tag>] [<package>|<rockspec>] [<new_version>] [<new_url>]

DESCRIPTION
	This is a utility function that writes a new rockspec, updating data
	from a previous one.
	
	If a package name is given, it downloads the latest rockspec from the
	default server. If a rockspec is given, it uses it instead. If no argument
	is given, it looks for a rockspec same way 'luarocks make' does.
	
	If the version number is not given and tag is passed using --tag,
	it is used as the version, with 'v' removed from beginning.
	Otherwise, it only increments the revision number of the given
	(or downloaded) rockspec.
	
	If a URL is given, it replaces the one from the old rockspec with the
	given URL. If a URL is not given and a new version is given, it tries
	to guess the new URL by replacing occurrences of the version number
	in the URL or tag. It also tries to download the new URL to determine
	the new MD5 checksum.
	
	If a tag is given, it replaces the one from the old rockspec. If there is
	an old tag but no new one passed, it is guessed in the same way URL is.
	
	WARNING: it writes the new rockspec to the current directory,
	overwriting the file if it already exists.
