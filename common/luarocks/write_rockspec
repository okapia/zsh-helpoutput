NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks write_rockspec - Write a template for a rockspec file.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks write_rockspec [--output=<file> ...] [<name>] [<version>] [<url>|<path>]

DESCRIPTION
	This command writes an initial version of a rockspec file,
	based on a name, a version, and a location (an URL or a local path).
	If only two arguments are given, the first one is considered the name and the
	second one is the location.
	If only one argument is given, it must be the location.
	If no arguments are given, current directory is used as location.
	LuaRocks will attempt to infer name and version if not given,
	using 'dev' as a fallback default version.
	
	Note that the generated file is a _starting point_ for writing a
	rockspec, and is not guaranteed to be complete or correct.
	
	--output=<file>          Write the rockspec with the given filename.
	                         If not given, a file is written in the current
	                         directory with a filename based on given name and version.
	--license="<string>"     A license string, such as "MIT/X11" or "GNU GPL v3".
	--summary="<txt>"        A short one-line description summary.
	--detailed="<txt>"       A longer description string.
	--homepage=<url>         Project homepage.
	--lua-versions=<ver>     Supported Lua versions.  Accepted values are: "5.1", "5.2",
	                         "5.3", "5.4", "5.1,5.2", "5.2,5.3", "5.3,5.4", "5.1,5.2,5.3",
	                         "5.2,5.3,5.4", or "5.1,5.2,5.3,5.4"
	--rockspec-format=<ver>  Rockspec format version, such as "1.0" or "1.1".
	--tag=<tag>              Tag to use. Will attempt to extract version number from it.
	--lib=<lib>[,<lib>]      A comma-separated list of libraries that C files need to
	                         link to.
