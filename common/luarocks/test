LuaRocks 3.0.3, the Lua package manager

NAME
	/usr/bin/luarocks test - Run the test suite in the current directory.

SYNOPSIS
	/usr/bin/luarocks test [--test-type=<type>] [<rockspec>] [-- <args>]

DESCRIPTION
	Run the test suite for the Lua project in the current directory.
	If the first argument is a rockspec, it will use it to determine
	the parameters for running tests; otherwise, it will attempt to
	detect the rockspec.
	
	Any additional arguments are forwarded to the test suite. 
	To make sure that any flags passed in <args> are not interpreted
	as LuaRocks flags, use -- to separate LuaRocks arguments from
	test suite arguments.
	
	--test-type=<type>  Specify the test suite type manually if it was not
	                    specified in the rockspec and it could not be
	                    auto-detected.
	
	--deps-mode=<mode>  How to handle dependencies. Four modes are supported:
	                    * all - use all trees from the rocks_trees list
	                      for finding dependencies
	                    * one - use only the current tree (possibly set
	                      with --tree)
	                    * order - use trees based on order (use the current
	                      tree and all trees below it on the rocks_trees list)
	                    * none - ignore dependencies altogether.
	                    The default mode may be set with the deps_mode entry
	                    in the configuration file.
	                    The current default is "one".
	                    Type '/usr/bin/luarocks' with no arguments to see
	                    your list of rocks trees.
