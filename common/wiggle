Wiggle - apply patches that 'patch' rejects.

Wiggle provides four distinct but related functions:
merge, diff, extract, and browse.
To get more detailed help on a function, select the function
before requesting help.  e.g.
    wiggle --diff --help

Options:
   --extract   -x    : select 'extract' function.
   --diff      -d    : select 'diff' function.
   --merge     -m    : select 'merge' function (default).
   --browse    -B    : select 'browse' function.

   --words     -w    : word-wise diff and merge.
   --lines     -l    : line-wise diff and merge.

   --patch     -p    : treat last file as a patch file.
   -1  -2  -3        : select which component of patch or merge to use.
   --reverse   -R    : swap 'before' and 'after' for diff function.
   --no-ignore -i    : Don't ignore already-applied changes.
   --show-wiggle -W  : Report wiggles like conflicts with an extra stanza.

   --help      -h    : get help.
   --version   -V    : get version of wiggle.
   --verbose   -v    : (potentially) be more verbose.
   --quiet     -q    : don't print un-necessary messages.

   --replace   -r    : replace first file with result of merger.

   --strip=    -p    : number of path components to strip from file names.

Wiggle needs to be given 1, 2, or 3 files.  Any one of these can
be given as '-' to signify standard input.
