  -l user     Log in using this user name.
  -n          Redirect input from /dev/null.
  -F config   Config file (default: ~/.ssh/config).

  -x          Disable X11 connection forwarding (default).
  -i file     Identity for public key authentication (default: ~/.ssh/identity)

  -T          Do not allocate a tty.
  -v          Verbose; display verbose debugging messages.
              Multiple -v increases verbosity.

  -L listen-port:host:port   Forward local port to remote address
  -R listen-port:host:port   Forward remote port to local address
              These cause ssh to listen for connections on a port, and
