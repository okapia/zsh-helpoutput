ARPing 2.15, by Thomas Habets <thomas@habets.se>
usage: arping [ -0aAbdDeFpPqrRuUv ] [ -w <us> ] [ -W <sec> ] [ -S <host/ip> ]
              [ -T <host/ip ] [ -s <MAC> ] [ -t <MAC> ] [ -c <count> ]
              [ -C <count> ] [ -i <interface> ] [ -m <type> ] <host/ip/MAC | -B>

Options:

    -0     Use this option to ping with source IP address 0.0.0.0. Use this
           when you haven't configured your interface yet.  Note that  this
           may  get  the  MAC-ping  unanswered.   This  is  an alias for -S
           0.0.0.0.
    -a     Audiable ping.
    -A     Only count addresses matching  requested  address  (This  *WILL*
           break  most things you do. Only useful if you are arpinging many
           hosts at once. See arping-scan-net.sh for an example).
    -b     Like -0 but source broadcast source  address  (255.255.255.255).
           Note that this may get the arping unanswered since it's not nor-
           mal behavior for a host.
    -B     Use instead of host if you want to address 255.255.255.255.
    -c count
           Only send count requests.
    -C count
           Only wait for this many replies, regardless of -c and -w.
    -d     Find duplicate replies. Exit with 1 if there are answers from
           two different MAC addresses.
    -D     Display answers as exclamation points and missing packets as dots.
    -e     Like -a but beep when there is no reply.
    -F     Don't try to be smart about the interface name.  (even  if  this
           switch is not given, -i overrides smartness)
    -h     Displays a help message and exits.
    -i interface
           Use the specified interface.
    -m type
           Type of timestamp to use for incoming packets. Use -vv when
           pinging to list available ones.
    -q     Does not display messages, except error messages.
    -r     Raw output: only the MAC/IP address is displayed for each reply.
    -R     Raw output: Like -r but shows "the other one", can  be  combined
           with -r.
    -s MAC Set source MAC address. You may need to use -p with this.
    -S IP  Like  -b and -0 but with set source address.  Note that this may
           get the arping unanswered if the target does not have routing to
           the  IP.  If you don't own the IP you are using, you may need to
           turn on promiscious mode on the interface (with -p).  With  this
           switch  you can find out what IP-address a host has without tak-
           ing an IP-address yourself.
    -t MAC Set target MAC address to use when pinging IP address.
    -T IP  Use -T as target address when pinging MACs that won't respond to
           a broadcast ping but perhaps to a directed broadcast.
           Example:
           To check the address of MAC-A, use knowledge of MAC-B and  IP-B.
           $ arping -S <IP-B> -s <MAC-B> -p <MAC-A>
    -p     Turn  on  promiscious  mode  on interface, use this if you don't
           "own" the MAC address you are using.
    -P     Send ARP replies instead of requests. Useful with -U.
    -u     Show index=received/sent instead  of  just  index=received  when
           pinging MACs.
    -U     Send unsolicited ARP.
    -v     Verbose output. Use twice for more messages.
    -w     Time to wait between pings, in microseconds.
    -W     Same as -w, but in floating point seconds.
