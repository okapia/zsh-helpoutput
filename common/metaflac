Usage:
  metaflac [options] [operations] FLACfile [FLACfile ...]

Use metaflac to list, add, remove, or edit metadata in one or more FLAC files.
You may perform one major operation, or many shorthand operations at a time.

Options:
--preserve-modtime    Preserve the original modification time in spite of edits
--with-filename       Prefix each output line with the FLAC file name
                      (the default if more than one FLAC file is specified)
--no-filename         Do not prefix each output line with the FLAC file name
                      (the default if only one FLAC file is specified)
--no-utf8-convert     Do not convert Vorbis comments from UTF-8 to local charset,
                      or vice versa.  This is useful for scripts.
--dont-use-padding    By default metaflac tries to use padding where possible
                      to avoid rewriting the entire file if the metadata size
                      changes.  Use this option to tell metaflac to not take
                      advantage of padding this way.

Shorthand operations:
--show-md5sum         Show the MD5 signature from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-min-blocksize  Show the minimum block size from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-max-blocksize  Show the maximum block size from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-min-framesize  Show the minimum frame size from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-max-framesize  Show the maximum frame size from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-sample-rate    Show the sample rate from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-channels       Show the number of channels from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-bps            Show the # of bits per sample from the STREAMINFO block.
--show-total-samples  Show the total # of samples from the STREAMINFO block.

--show-vc-vendor      Show the vendor string from the VORBIS_COMMENT block.
--show-vc-field=name  Show all Vorbis comment fields where the the field name
                      matches 'name'.
--remove-vc-field=name  Remove all Vorbis comment fields whose field name
                      is 'name'.
--remove-vc-firstfield=name  Remove first Vorbis comment field whose field
                      name is 'name'.
--remove-vc-all       Remove all Vorbis comment fields, leaving only the
                      vendor string in the VORBIS_COMMENT block.
--set-vc-field=field  Add a Vorbis comment field.  The field must comply with
                      the Vorbis comment spec, of the form "NAME=VALUE".  If
                      there is currently no VORBIS_COMMENT block, one will be
                      created.
--import-vc-from=file Import Vorbis comments from a file.  Use '-' for stdin.
                      Each line should be of the form NAME=VALUE.  Multi-
                      line comments are currently not supported.  Specify
                      --remove-vc-all and/or --no-utf8-convert before
                      --import-vc-from if necessary.
--export-vc-to=file   Export Vorbis comments to a file.  Use '-' for stdin.
                      Each line will be of the form NAME=VALUE.  Specify
                      --no-utf8-convert if necessary.
--import-cuesheet-from=file  Import a cuesheet from a file.  Only one FLAC
                      file may be specified.  A seekpoint will be added for
                      each index point in the cuesheet to the SEEKTABLE unless
                      --no-cued-seekpoints is specified.
--export-cuesheet-to=file  Export CUESHEET block to a cuesheet file, suitable
                      for use by CD authoring software.  Use '-' for stdin.
                      Only one FLAC file may be specified on the command line.
--add-replay-gain     Calculates the title and album gains/peaks of the given
                      FLAC files as if all the files were part of one album,
                      then stores them in the VORBIS_COMMENT block.  The tags
                      are the same as those used by vorbisgain.  Existing
                      ReplayGain tags will be replaced.  If only one FLAC file
                      is given, the album and title gains will be the same.
                      Since this operation requires two passes, it is always
                      executed last, after all other operations have been
                      completed and written to disk.  All FLAC files specified
                      must have the same resolution, sample rate, and number
                      of channels.  The sample rate must be one of 8, 11.025,
                      12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, or 48 kHz.
--add-seekpoint={#|X|#x|#s}  Add seek points to a SEEKTABLE block
       #  : a specific sample number for a seek point
       X  : a placeholder point (always goes at the end of the SEEKTABLE)
       #x : # evenly spaced seekpoints, the first being at sample 0
       #s : a seekpoint every # seconds; # does not have to be a whole number
                      If no SEEKTABLE block exists, one will be created.  If
                      one already exists, points will be added to the existing
                      table, and any duplicates will be turned into placeholder
                      points.  You may use many --add-seekpoint options; the
                      resulting SEEKTABLE will be the unique-ified union of
                      all such values.  Example: --add-seekpoint=100x
                      --add-seekpoint=3.5s will add 100 evenly spaced
                      seekpoints and a seekpoint every 3.5 seconds.
--add-padding=length  Add a padding block of the given length (in bytes).
                      The overall length of the new block will be 4 + length;
                      the extra 4 bytes is for the metadata block header.

Major operations:
--version
    Show the metaflac version number.
--list
    List the contents of one or more metadata blocks to stdout.  By default,
    all metadata blocks are listed in text format.  Use the following options
    to change this behavior:

    --block-number=#[,#[...]]
    An optional comma-separated list of block numbers to display.  The first
    block, the STREAMINFO block, is block 0.

    --block-type=type[,type[...]]
    --except-block-type=type[,type[...]]
    An optional comma-separated list of block types to included or ignored
    with this option.  Use only one of --block-type or --except-block-type.
    The valid block types are: STREAMINFO, PADDING, APPLICATION, SEEKTABLE,
    VORBIS_COMMENT.  You may narrow down the types of APPLICATION blocks
    displayed as follows:
        APPLICATION:abcd        The APPLICATION block(s) whose textual repre-
                                sentation of the 4-byte ID is "abcd"
        APPLICATION:0xXXXXXXXX  The APPLICATION block(s) whose hexadecimal big-
                                endian representation of the 4-byte ID is
                                "0xXXXXXXXX".  For the example "abcd" above the
                                hexadecimal equivalalent is 0x61626364

    NOTE: if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type are specified,
          the result is the logical AND of both arguments.

    --application-data-format=hexdump|text
    If the application block you are displaying contains binary data but your
    --data-format=text, you can display a hex dump of the application data
    contents instead using --application-data-format=hexdump

--remove
    Remove one or more metadata blocks from the metadata.  Unless
    --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be replaced with padding.
    You may not remove the STREAMINFO block.

    --block-number=#[,#[...]]
    --block-type=type[,type[...]]
    --except-block-type=type[,type[...]]
    See --list above for usage.

    NOTE: if both --block-number and --[except-]block-type are specified,
          the result is the logical AND of both arguments.

--remove-all
    Remove all metadata blocks (except the STREAMINFO block) from the
    metadata.  Unless --dont-use-padding is specified, the blocks will be
    replaced with padding.

--merge-padding
    Merge adjacent PADDING blocks into single blocks.

--sort-padding
    Move all PADDING blocks to the end of the metadata and merge them into a
    single block.
