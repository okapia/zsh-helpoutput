  Usage: drill name [@server] [type] [class]
	<name>  can be a domain name or an IP address (-x lookups)
	<type>  defaults to A
	<class> defaults to IN

	arguments may be placed in random order

  Options:
	-D		enable DNSSEC (DO bit)
	-T		trace from the root down to <name>
	-S		chase signature(s) from <name> to a known key [*]
	-I <address>	source address to query from
	-V <number>	verbosity (0-5)
	-Q		quiet mode (overrules -V)

	-f file		read packet from file and send it
	-i file		read packet from file and print it
	-w file		write answer packet to file
	-q file		write query packet to file
	-h		show this help
	-v		show version

  Query options:
	-4		stay on ip4
	-6		stay on ip6
	-a		fallback to EDNS0 and TCP if the answer is truncated
	-b <bufsize>	use <bufsize> as the buffer size (defaults to 512 b)
	-c <file>	use file for rescursive nameserver configuration
			(/etc/resolv.conf)
	-k <file>	specify a file that contains a trusted DNSSEC key [**]
			Used to verify any signatures in the current answer.
			When DNSSEC enabled tracing (-TD) or signature
			chasing (-S) and no key files are given, keys are read
			from: /etc/dns/root.key
	-o <mnemonic>	set flags to:
			[QR|qr][AA|aa][TC|tc][RD|rd][CD|cd][RA|ra][AD|ad]
			lowercase: unset bit, uppercase: set bit
	-p <port>	use <port> as remote port number
	-s		show the DS RR for each key in a packet
	-u		send the query with udp (the default)
	-x		do a reverse lookup
	when doing a secure trace:
	-r <file>	use file as root servers hint file
	-t		send the query with tcp (connected)
	-d <domain>	use domain as the start point for the trace
	-y <name:key[:algo]>	specify named base64 tsig key, and optional an
			algorithm (defaults to hmac-md5.sig-alg.reg.int)
	-z		don't randomize the nameservers before use

  [*] = enables/implies DNSSEC
  [**] = can be given more than once
