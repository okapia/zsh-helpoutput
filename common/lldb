       -h 
       --help 
            Prints out the usage information for the LLDB debugger.

       -v 
       --version 
            Prints out the current version number of the LLDB debugger.

       -a <arch>
       --arch <arch>
            Tells the debugger to use the specified architecture when starting
            and running the program.  <architecture> must be one of the
            architectures for which the program was compiled.

       -f <filename>
       --file <filename>
            Tells the debugger to use the file <filename> as the program to be
            debugged.

       -c <filename>
       --core <filename>
            Tells the debugger to use the fullpath to <path> as the core file.

       -p <pid>
       --attach-pid <pid>
            Tells the debugger to attach to a process with the given pid.

       -n <process-name>
       --attach-name <process-name>
            Tells the debugger to attach to a process with the given name.

       -w 
       --wait-for 
            Tells the debugger to wait for a process with the given pid or name
            to launch before attaching.

       -s <filename>
       --source <filename>
            Tells the debugger to read in and execute the lldb commands in the
            given file, after any file provided on the command line has been
            loaded.

       -o 
       --one-line 
            Tells the debugger to execute this one-line lldb command after any
            file provided on the command line has been loaded.

       -S <filename>
       --source-before-file <filename>
            Tells the debugger to read in and execute the lldb commands in the
            given file, before any file provided on the command line has been
            loaded.

       -O 
       --one-line-before-file 
            Tells the debugger to execute this one-line lldb command before any
            file provided on the command line has been loaded.

       -k 
       --one-line-on-crash 
            When in batch mode, tells the debugger to execute this one-line
            lldb command if the target crashes.

       -K <filename>
       --source-on-crash <filename>
            When in batch mode, tells the debugger to source this file of lldb
            commands if the target crashes.

       -Q 
       --source-quietly 
            Tells the debugger to execute this one-line lldb command before any
            file provided on the command line has been loaded.

       -b 
       --batch 
            Tells the debugger to running the commands from -s, -S, -o & -O,
            and then quit.  However if any run command stopped due to a signal
            or crash, the debugger will return to the interactive prompt at the
            place of the crash.

       -e 
       --editor 
            Tells the debugger to open source files using the host's "external
            editor" mechanism.

       -x 
       --no-lldbinit 
            Do not automatically parse any '.lldbinit' files.

       -X 
       --no-use-colors 
            Do not use colors.

       -P 
       --python-path 
            Prints out the path to the lldb.py file for this version of lldb.

       -l <script-language>
       --script-language <script-language>
            Tells the debugger to use the specified scripting language for
            user-defined scripts, rather than the default.  Valid scripting
            languages that can be specified include Python, Perl, Ruby and Tcl.
            Currently only the Python extensions have been implemented.

       -d 
       --debug 
            Tells the debugger to print out extra information for debugging
            itself.

       -r 
       --repl 
            Runs lldb in REPL mode with a stub process.

       -R 
       --repl-language 
            Chooses the language for the REPL.


  Notes:

       Multiple "-s" and "-o" options can be provided.  They will be processed
       from left to right in order, with the source files and commands
       interleaved.  The same is true of the "-S" and "-O" options.  The before
       file and after file sets can intermixed freely, the command parser will
       sort them out.  The order of the file specifiers ("-c", "-f", etc.) is
       not significant in this regard.


       If you don't provide -f then the first argument will be the file to be
       debugged which means that 'lldb -- <filename> [<ARG1> [<ARG2>]]' also
       works.  But remember to end the options with "--" if any of your
       arguments have a "-" in them.
