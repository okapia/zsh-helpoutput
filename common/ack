Usage: ack [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILES OR DIRECTORIES]

Search for PATTERN in each source file in the tree from the current
directory on down.  If any files or directories are specified, then
only those files and directories are checked.  ack may also search
STDIN, but only if no file or directory arguments are specified,
or if one of them is "-".

Default switches may be specified in an .ackrc file. If you want no dependency
on the environment, turn it off with --noenv.

Example: ack -i select

Searching:
  -i, --ignore-case             Ignore case distinctions in PATTERN
  -S, --[no]smart-case          Ignore case distinctions in PATTERN,
                                only if PATTERN contains no upper case.
                                Ignored if -i or -I are specified.
  -I                            Turns on case-sensitivity in PATTERN.
                                Negates -i and --smart-case.
  -v, --invert-match            Invert match: select non-matching lines
  -w, --word-regexp             Force PATTERN to match only whole words
  -Q, --literal                 Quote all metacharacters; PATTERN is literal
  --lines=NUM                   Only print line(s) NUM of each file.  No
                                pattern is matched.
  --match PATTERN               Specify PATTERN explicitly. Typically omitted.

Search output:
  -l, --files-with-matches      Only print filenames containing matches
  -L, --files-without-matches   Only print filenames with no matches
  --output=expr                 Output the evaluation of expr for each line
                                (turns off text highlighting)
  -o                            Show only the part of a line matching PATTERN
                                Same as --output='$&'
  --passthru                    Print all lines, whether matching or not
  -m, --max-count=NUM           Stop searching in each file after NUM matches
  -1                            Stop searching after one match of any kind
  -H, --with-filename           Print the filename for each match (default:
                                on unless explicitly searching a single file)
  -h, --no-filename             Suppress the prefixing filename on output
  -c, --count                   Show number of lines matching per file
  --[no]column                  Show the column number of the first match

  -A NUM, --after-context=NUM   Print NUM lines of trailing context after
                                matching lines.
  -B NUM, --before-context=NUM  Print NUM lines of leading context before
                                matching lines.
  -C [NUM], --context[=NUM]     Print NUM lines (default 2) of output context.

  --print0                      Print null byte as separator between filenames,
                                only works with -f, -g, -l, -L or -c.

  -s                            Suppress error messages about nonexistent or
                                unreadable files.


File presentation:
  --pager=COMMAND               Pipes all ack output through COMMAND.  For
                                example, --pager="less -R".  Ignored if output
                                is redirected.
  --nopager                     Do not send output through a pager.  Cancels
                                any setting in ~/.ackrc, ACK_PAGER or
                                ACK_PAGER_COLOR.
  --[no]heading                 Print a filename heading above each file's
                                results.  (default: on when used interactively)

                                files.  (default: on when used interactively)
  --group                       Same as --heading --break
  --nogroup                     Same as --noheading --nobreak
  --[no]proximate               Separate match output with blank lines unless
                                they are on adjacent lines.
  --[no]color                   Highlight the matching text (default: on unless
                                output is redirected, or on Windows)
  --[no]colour                  Same as --[no]color
  --color-filename=COLOR
  --color-match=COLOR
  --color-colno=COLOR
  --color-lineno=COLOR          Set the color for filenames, matches, line and
                                column numbers.
  --flush                       Flush output immediately, even when ack is used
                                non-interactively (when output goes to a pipe or
                                file).

                                searching.  The PATTERN must not be specified.
  -g                            Same as -f, but only select files matching
                                PATTERN.
  --sort-files                  Sort the found files lexically.

Filter specifications:
    If FILTER is "ext", ARGS is a list of extensions checked against the
        file's extension.
    If FILTER is "is", ARGS must match the file's name exactly.
    If FILTER is "match", ARGS is matched as a case-insensitive regex
        against the filename.
    If FILTER is "firstlinematch", ARGS is matched as a regex the first
        line of the file's contents.

Exit status is 0 if match, 1 if no match.
