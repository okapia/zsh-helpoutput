oggenc from vorbis-tools 1.4.0 by the Xiph.Org Foundation (http://www.xiph.org/)

Usage: oggenc [options] inputfile [...]

OPTIONS:
 General:
 -Q, --quiet          Produce no output to stderr
 -h, --help           Print this help text
 -V, --version        Print the version number
 -k, --skeleton       Adds an Ogg Skeleton bitstream
 -r, --raw            Raw mode. Input files are read directly as PCM data
 -B, --raw-bits=n     Set bits/sample for raw input; default is 16
 -C, --raw-chan=n     Set number of channels for raw input; default is 2
 -R, --raw-rate=n     Set samples/sec for raw input; default is 44100
 --raw-endianness     1 for bigendian, 0 for little (defaults to 0)
 -b, --bitrate        Choose a nominal bitrate to encode at. Attempt
                      to encode at a bitrate averaging this. Takes an
                      argument in kbps. By default, this produces a VBR
                      encoding, equivalent to using -q or --quality.
                      See the --managed option to use a managed bitrate
                      targetting the selected bitrate.
 --managed            Enable the bitrate management engine. This will allow
                      much greater control over the precise bitrate(s) used,
                      but encoding will be much slower. Don't use it unless
                      you have a strong need for detailed control over
                      bitrate, such as for streaming.
 -m, --min-bitrate    Specify a minimum bitrate (in kbps). Useful for
                      encoding for a fixed-size channel. Using this will
                      automatically enable managed bitrate mode (see
                      --managed).
 -M, --max-bitrate    Specify a maximum bitrate in kbps. Useful for
                      streaming applications. Using this will automatically
                      enable managed bitrate mode (see --managed).
 --advanced-encode-option option=value
                      Sets an advanced encoder option to the given value.
                      The valid options (and their values) are documented
                      in the man page supplied with this program. They are
                      for advanced users only, and should be used with
                      caution.
 -q, --quality        Specify quality, between -1 (very low) and 10 (very
                      high), instead of specifying a particular bitrate.
                      This is the normal mode of operation.
                      Fractional qualities (e.g. 2.75) are permitted
                      The default quality level is 3.
 --resample n         Resample input data to sampling rate n (Hz)
 --downmix            Downmix stereo to mono. Only allowed on stereo
                      input.
 --scale              Input scaling factor (helps with clipping inputs).
 -s, --serial         Specify a serial number for the stream. If encoding
                      multiple files, this will be incremented for each
                      stream after the first.
 --discard-comments   Prevents comments in FLAC and Ogg FLAC files from
                      being copied to the output Ogg Vorbis file.
 --ignorelength       Ignore the datalength in Wave headers. This allows
                      support for files > 4GB and STDIN data streams. 

 Naming:
 -o, --output=fn      Write file to fn (only valid in single-file mode)
 -n, --names=string   Produce filenames as this string, with %a, %t, %l,
                      %n, %d replaced by artist, title, album, track number,
                      and date, respectively (see below for specifying these).
                      %% gives a literal %.
 -X, --name-remove=s  Remove the specified characters from parameters to the
                      -n format string. Useful to ensure legal filenames.
 -P, --name-replace=s Replace characters removed by --name-remove with the
                      characters specified. If this string is shorter than the
                      --name-remove list or is not specified, the extra
                      characters are just removed.
                      Default settings for the above two arguments are platform
                      specific.
 --utf8               Tells oggenc that the command line parameters date, title,
                      album, artist, genre, and comment are already in UTF-8.
                      On Windows, this switch applies to file names too.
 -c, --comment=c      Add the given string as an extra comment. This may be
                      used multiple times. The argument should be in the
                      format "tag=value".
 -d, --date           Date for track (usually date of performance)
 -N, --tracknum       Track number for this track
 -t, --title          Title for this track
 -l, --album          Name of album
 -a, --artist         Name of artist
 -G, --genre          Genre of track
 -L, --lyrics         Include lyrics from given file (.srt or .lrc format)
 -Y, --lyrics-language  Sets the language for the lyrics
                      If multiple input files are given, then multiple
                      instances of the previous eight arguments will be used,
                      in the order they are given. If fewer titles are
                      specified than files, OggEnc will print a warning, and
                      reuse the final one for the remaining files. If fewer
                      track numbers are given, the remaining files will be
                      unnumbered. If fewer lyrics are given, the remaining
                      files will not have lyrics added. For the others, the
                      final tag will be reused for all others without warning
                      (so you can specify a date once, for example, and have
                      it used for all the files)

INPUT FILES:
 OggEnc input files must currently be 24, 16, or 8 bit PCM Wave, AIFF, or AIFF/C
 files, 32 bit IEEE floating point Wave, and optionally FLAC or Ogg FLAC. Files
  may be mono or stereo (or more channels) and any sample rate.
 Alternatively, the --raw option may be used to use a raw PCM data file, which
 must be 16 bit stereo little-endian PCM ('headerless Wave'), unless additional
 parameters for raw mode are specified.
 You can specify taking the file from stdin by using - as the input filename.
 In this mode, output is to stdout unless an output filename is specified
 with -o
 Lyrics files may be in SubRip (.srt) or LRC (.lrc) format
