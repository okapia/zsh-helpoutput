Subcommands:

help
	Print usage message.

boot [-R] [-w|-W] [-- boot_arguments]
	Activates (boots) specified zone.  See zoneadm(1m) for valid boot
	arguments.

shutdown [-r [-- boot_arguments]
	Cleanly shut down (or reboot) the zone.
	See zoneadm(1m) for valid boot arguments.

halt
	Halts specified zone, bypassing shutdown scripts and removing runtime
	resources of the zone.

ready
	Prepares a zone for running applications but does not start any user
	processes in the zone.

reboot [-w|-W] [-- boot_arguments]
	Restarts the zone (equivalent to a halt / boot sequence).
	See zoneadm(1m) for valid boot arguments.

list [-ci] [-p|-s|-v]
	Lists the current zones, or a specific zone if indicated.  By default,
	all running zones are listed, though this can be expanded to all
	installed zones with the -i option or all configured zones with the
	-c option.  When used with the general -z <zone> and/or -u <uuid-match>
	options, lists only the specified matching zone, but lists it
	regardless of its state, and the -i and -c options are disallowed.  The
	-v option can be used to display verbose information: zone name, id,
	current state, root directory and options.  The -p option can be used
	to request machine-parsable output.  The -v and -p options are mutually
	exclusive.  If neither -v nor -p is used, just the zone name is listed.

verify
	Check to make sure the configuration can safely be instantiated
	on the machine: physical network interfaces exist, etc.

install [-x force-zpool-import|force-zpool-create|force-zpool-create-all]
		[brand-specific args]
	Install the configuration on to the  system.
	The -x force-zpool-import option can be used to forcibly re-use
	existing zpool resources for installation. The -x force-zpool-create-all
	option can be used to forcibly create all zpool resources.
	Use -x force-zpool-create=zpoolname{,zpoolname,zpoolname,...} to limit
	this option to a specific set of zpools.
	All other arguments are passed to the brand installation function;
	see brands(5) for more information.

uninstall [-F] [-x force-zpool-destroy|force-zpool-destroy-all]
		[brand-specific args]
	Uninstall the configuration from the system.  The -F flag can be used
	to force the action.
	The -x force-zpool-destroy-all option can be used to destroy all zpools.
	Use -x force-zpool-destroy=zpoolname{,zpoolname,zpoolname,...} to
	limit this option to a specific set of zpools.
	All other arguments are passed to the brand uninstall function;
	see brands(5) for more information.

clone [-m method] [-s <ZFS snapshot>]
		[-x force-zpool-import|force-zpool-create|force-zpool-create-all]
		[brand-specific args] zonename
	Clone the installation of another zone.  The -m option can be used to
	specify 'copy' which forces a copy of the source zone.  The -s option
	can be used to specify the name of a ZFS snapshot that was taken from
	a previous clone command.  The snapshot will be used as the source
	instead of creating a new ZFS snapshot.
	The -x force-zpool-import option can be used to forcibly re-use
	existing zpool resources. The -x force-zpool-create-all option can be
	used to forcibly create all zpool resources.
	Use -x force-zpool-create=zpoolname{,zpoolname,zpoolname,...} to limit
	this option to a specific set of zpools.
	All other arguments are passed to the brand clone function;
	see brands(5) for more information.

move zonepath
	Move the zone to a new zonepath.

detach [-n] [brand-specific args]
	Detach the zone from the system. The zone state is changed to
	'configured' (but the files under the zonepath are untouched).
	The zone can subsequently be attached, or can be moved to another
	system and attached there.  The -n option can be used to specify
	'no-execute' mode.  When -n is used, the information needed to attach
	the zone is sent to standard output but the zone is not actually
	detached.  All other arguments are passed to the brand detach function;
	see brands(5) for more information.

attach [-F] [-x force-zpool-import|force-zpool-create|force-zpool-create-all]
		[-n <path>] [brand-specific args]
	Attach the zone to the system.  The zone state must be 'configured'
	prior to attach; upon successful completion, the zone state will be
	'installed'.  The system software on the current system must be
	compatible with the software on the zone's original system.
	Specify -F to force the attach and skip software compatibility tests.
	The -n option can be used to specify 'no-execute' mode.  When -n is
	used, the information needed to attach the zone is read from the
	specified path and the configuration is only validated.  The path can
	be '-' to specify standard input.  The -F and -n options are mutually
	exclusive.
	Specify -x force-zpool-import to forcibly re-use existing zpool resources
	Specify -x force-zpool-create-all to forcibly create all zpool resources.
	Use -x force-zpool-create=zpoolname{,zpoolname,zpoolname,...} to limit
	this option to a specific set of zpools
	All other arguments are passed to the brand attach function;
	see brands(5) for more information.

mark incomplete
	Set the state of the zone.  This can be used to force the zone
	state to 'incomplete' administratively if some activity has rendered
	the zone permanently unusable.  The only valid state that may be
	specified is 'incomplete'.

apply [-n] [-q]
	Reconfigure a running zone to match persistent configuration of a zone
	maintained through zonecfg(1M) actions. See respective brand man page
	for details on resources supported by the live zone reconfiguration.

	The following options are supported:
	-n
		Run the reconfiguration in a dry-run mode.
	-q
		Quiet mode. Suppress all messages and return a status code
		only.

suspend
	Suspend a running zone to disk.

savecore [-L] [-f <crash dump>]
	Save a crash dump of the zone.

set-prom [-c] variable=[value]
	

get-prom [variable]
	

rename zonename
	Rename a zone to a new zonename.
	The zone must be in configured or installed state.
