Subcommands:

help
	Print usage message.

boot [-- boot_arguments]
	Activates (boots) specified zone.  See zoneadm(1m) for valid boot
	arguments.

halt
	Halts specified zone, bypassing shutdown scripts and removing runtime
	resources of the zone.

ready
	Prepares a zone for running applications but does not start any user
	processes in the zone.

reboot [-- boot_arguments]
	Restarts the zone (equivalent to a halt / boot sequence).
	Fails if the zone is not active.  See zoneadm(1m) for valid boot
	arguments.

list [-cipv]
	Lists the current zones, or a specific zone if indicated.  By default,
	all running zones are listed, though this can be expanded to all
	installed zones with the -i option or all configured zones with the
	-c option.  When used with the general -z <zone> and/or -u <uuid-match>
	options, lists only the specified matching zone, but lists it
	regardless of its state, and the -i and -c options are disallowed.  The
	-v option can be used to display verbose information: zone name, id,
	current state, root directory and options.  The -p option can be used
	to request machine-parsable output.  The -v and -p options are mutually
	exclusive.  If neither -v nor -p is used, just the zone name is listed.

verify
	Check to make sure the configuration can safely be instantiated
	on the machine: physical network interfaces exist, etc.

install [-x nodataset] [brand-specific args]
	Install the configuration on to the system.  The -x nodataset option
	can be used to prevent the creation of a new ZFS file system for the
	zone (assuming the zonepath is within a ZFS file system).
	All other arguments are passed to the brand installation function;
	see brand(4) for more information.

uninstall [-F]
	Uninstall the configuration from the system.  The -F flag can be used
	to force the action.

clone [-m method] [-s <ZFS snapshot>] zonename
	Clone the installation of another zone.  The -m option can be used to
	specify 'copy' which forces a copy of the source zone.  The -s option
	can be used to specify the name of a ZFS snapshot that was taken from
	a previous clone command.  The snapshot will be used as the source
	instead of creating a new ZFS snapshot.

move zonepath
	Move the zone to a new zonepath.

detach [-n]
	Detach the zone from the system. The zone state is changed to
	'configured' (but the files under the zonepath are untouched).
	The zone can subsequently be attached, or can be moved to another
	system and attached there. The -n option can be used to specify
	'no-execute' mode. When -n is used, the information needed to attach
	the zone is sent to stdout but the zone is not actually detached.

attach [-F] [-n <path>] [-b patchid]* [-u|-U]
	Attach the zone to the system.  The zone state must be 'configured'
	prior to attach; upon successful completion, the zone state will be
	'installed'.  The system software on the current system must be
	compatible with the software on the zone's original system or use
	the -u|U option to update the zone to the current system software.
	Specify one or more -b patchid options to backout the patch from the
	zone.  Specify -F to force the attach and skip software compatibility
	tests.  The -n option can be used to specify 'no-execute' mode.  When
	-n is used, the information needed to attach the zone is read from the
	specified path and the configuration is only validated.  The path can
	be '-' to specify standard input.  The -F, -n and -u|U options are
	mutually exclusive.

mark incomplete
	Set the state of the zone.  This can be used to force the zone
	state to 'incomplete' administratively if some activity has rendered
	the zone permanently unusable.  The only valid state that may be
	specified is 'incomplete'.
