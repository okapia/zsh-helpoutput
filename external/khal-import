Usage: khal import [OPTIONS] ICS

  Import events from an .ics file.

  If an event with the same UID is already present in the (implicitly)
  selected calendar import will ask before updating (i.e. overwriting) that
  old event with the imported one, unless --batch is given, than it will
  always update. If this behaviour is not desired, use the `--random-uid`
  flag to generate a new, random UID. If no calendar is specified (and not
  `--batch`), you will be asked to choose a calendar. You can either enter
  the number printed behind each calendar's name or any unique prefix of a
  calendar's name.

Options:
  -a, --include-calendar CAL  The calendar to use.
  --batch                     do not ask for any confirmation.
  -r, --random_uid            Select a random uid.
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
