Fetch dependencies of a package from the network.

Usage:
    cargo fetch [options]

Options:
    -h, --help               Print this message
    --manifest-path PATH     Path to the manifest to fetch dependencies for
    -v, --verbose ...        Use verbose output
    -q, --quiet              No output printed to stdout
    --color WHEN             Coloring: auto, always, never
    --frozen                 Require Cargo.lock and cache are up to date
    --locked                 Require Cargo.lock is up to date

If a lockfile is available, this command will ensure that all of the git
dependencies and/or registries dependencies are downloaded and locally
available. The network is never touched after a `cargo fetch` unless
the lockfile changes.

If the lockfile is not available, then this is the equivalent of
`cargo generate-lockfile`. A lockfile is generated and dependencies are also
all updated.
