The yank command removes a previously pushed crate's version from the server's
index. This command does not delete any data, and the crate will still be
available for download via the registry's download link.

Note that existing crates locked to a yanked version will still be able to
download the yanked version to use it. Cargo will, however, not allow any new
crates to be locked to any yanked version.
