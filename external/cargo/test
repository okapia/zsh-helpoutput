Execute all unit and integration tests of a local package

Usage:
    cargo test [options] [--] [<args>...]

Options:
    -h, --help                   Print this message
    --lib                        Test only this package's library
    --doc                        Test only this library's documentation
    --bin NAME                   Test only the specified binary
    --example NAME               Test only the specified example
    --test NAME                  Test only the specified integration test target
    --bench NAME                 Test only the specified benchmark target
    --no-run                     Compile, but don't run tests
    -p SPEC, --package SPEC ...  Package to run tests for
    -j N, --jobs N               Number of parallel jobs, defaults to # of CPUs
    --release                    Build artifacts in release mode, with optimizations
    --features FEATURES          Space-separated list of features to also build
    --all-features               Build all available features
    --no-default-features        Do not build the `default` feature
    --target TRIPLE              Build for the target triple
    --manifest-path PATH         Path to the manifest to build tests for
    -v, --verbose ...            Use verbose output
    -q, --quiet                  No output printed to stdout
    --color WHEN                 Coloring: auto, always, never
    --message-format FMT         Error format: human, json [default: human]
    --no-fail-fast               Run all tests regardless of failure
    --frozen                     Require Cargo.lock and cache are up to date
    --locked                     Require Cargo.lock is up to date

All of the trailing arguments are passed to the test binaries generated for
filtering tests and generally providing options configuring how they run. For
example, this will run all tests with the name `foo` in their name:

    cargo test foo

If the --package argument is given, then SPEC is a package id specification
which indicates which package should be tested. If it is not given, then the
current package is tested. For more information on SPEC and its format, see the
`cargo help pkgid` command.

The --jobs argument affects the building of the test executable but does
not affect how many jobs are used when running the tests.

Compilation can be configured via the `test` profile in the manifest.

By default the rust test harness hides output from test execution to
keep results readable. Test output can be recovered (e.g. for debugging)
by passing `--nocapture` to the test binaries:

  cargo test -- --nocapture

To get the list of all options available for the test binaries use this:

  cargo test -- --help
