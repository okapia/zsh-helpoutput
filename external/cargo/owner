This command will modify the owners for a crate on the specified registry (or
default). Owners of a crate can upload new versions and yank old versions.
Explicitly named owners can also modify the set of owners, so take care!

    See https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html#cargo-owner
    for detailed documentation and troubleshooting.
