This command will modify the owners for a package on the specified registry (or
default). Note that owners of a package can upload new versions, yank old
versions. Explicitly named owners can also modify the set of owners, so take
caution!

See http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html#cargo-owner for detailed documentation
and troubleshooting.
