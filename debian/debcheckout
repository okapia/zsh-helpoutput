    debcheckout [*OPTIONS*] *PACKAGE* [*DESTDIR*]
    debcheckout [*OPTIONS*] *REPOSITORY_URL* [*DESTDIR*]
    debcheckout --help

Options:
    GENERAL OPTIONS

    -a, --auth
        Work in authenticated mode; this means that for known repositories
        (mainly those hosted on *http://alioth.debian.org*) URL rewriting is
        attempted before checking out, to ensure that the repository can be
        committed to. For example, for subversion repositories hosted on
        alioth this means that *svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/...* will be used
        instead of *svn://svn.debian.org/...*.

    -d, --details
        Only print a list of detailed information about the package
        repository, without checking it out; the output format is a list of
        fields, each field being a pair of TAB-separated field name and
        field value. The actual fields depend on the repository type. This
        action might require a network connection to the remote repository.

        Also see -p. This option and -p are mutually exclusive.

    -h, --help
        Print a detailed help message and exit.

    -p, --print
        Only print a summary about package repository information, without
        checking it out; the output format is TAB-separated with two fields:
        repository type, repository URL. This action works offline, it only
        uses "static" information as known by APT's cache.

        Also see -d. This option and -d are mutually exclusive.

    -t *TYPE*, --type *TYPE*
        Override the repository type (which defaults to some heuristics
        based on the URL or, in case of heuristic failure, the fallback
        "svn"); should be one of the currently supported repository types.

    -u *USERNAME*, --user *USERNAME*
        Specify the login name to be used in authenticated mode (see -a).
        This option implies -a: you don't need to specify both.

    -f, --file
        Specify that the named file should be extracted from the repository
        and placed in the destination directory. May be used more than once
        to extract mutliple files.

    --source=never|auto|download-only|always
        Some packages only place the debian directory in version control.
        debcheckout can retrieve the remaining parts of the source using
        apt-get source and move the files into the checkout.

        never
            Only use the repository.

        auto (default)
            If the repository only contains the debian directory, retrieve
            the source package, unpack it, and also place the .orig.tar.gz
            file into the current directory. Else, do nothing.

        download-only
            Always retrieve the *.orig.tar.gz* file, but do not unpack it.

        always
            Always retrieve the *.orig.tar.gz* file, and if the repository
            only contains the debian directory, unpack it.

    VCS-SPECIFIC OPTIONS

    *GIT-SPECIFIC OPTIONS*

    --git-track *BRANCHES*
        Specify a list of remote branches which will be set up for tracking
        (as in git branch --track, see git-branch(1)) after the remote Git
        repository has been cloned. The list should be given as a
        space-separated list of branch names.

        As a shorthand, the string "*" can be given to require tracking of
        all remote branches.
